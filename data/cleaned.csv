3,Pricy for it‚Äôs quality,"Giving four stars because the inner layer is just really awkward and uncomfortable especially while wearing it in the heat because it absorbs so much moisture and you can feel the piece of cloth moving around and it get‚Äôs to a point where every time you breathe in it the cloth attempts to enter your nostrils. It gets in the way way more than I‚Äôve thought but other than that, it‚Äôs alright.",Canada,2020-06-04
3,They fit small,"The fabric, elastic & overall quality is great. But the masks fit pretty small. I bought 4 adult & 2 kids masks. The pictures show compassion. The navy ones are small, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to wear them comfortably. If I talk, it almost comes off my nose. I would say I have an average face & nose size! I bought a pink one as well, it‚Äôs a bit bigger and fits much better. The smaller adult masks are close to the child size. I‚Äôm disappointed but love the company.",Canada,2020-06-27
4,Needs filters that aren't included!,"Most of the reason I ordered this is because I'm a hospital patient, I have to wear a mask anytime someone needs to spend a chunk of time with me, and the blue hospital-provided masks are too tight for my wide head, they just about cut my ears off after a few minutes. So I see this has wider elastics with it appears to be adjusters. But at their widest they're the same width as the hospital version! And I'm not 100% sure the adjusters move, they might just be an unusual design choice. So this feature is for people with small heads, never mind us wide people.

My biggest complaint is that it needs filters to, uh, filter, you know, keep me safe, as in WHY I'm wearing a mask, but it comes with ZERO! Plus, being in the hospital, I needed this NOW, before they move me somewhere (they actually changed my room the day it arrived, it nearly went to my now ex-room), so I only wanted to order from Amazon or served by Amazon. Amazon doesn't carry or serve the filters, that I can see. It should come with SOME to start out with!

Also I wanted black, missed the Navy Blue in the description, I wish the pictures showed that better.",Canada,2020-06-11
4,fast delivery & comfortable,i recieved the wrong colour but it saves me from wearing a sock stretched across my face so its fine. i can actually breathe in this mask so that's a huge bonus! its comfortable around my ears (at least for small trips out) it also arrived in like two days. overall im happy!,Canada,2020-05-20
4,Comfortable with customizable adjustment,"I bought 4 of these and will possibly purchase more. I purchased these for me and my two teenage sons, 13 and 15. The fit is comfortable especially since we are able to adjust the nose clip and ear piece. Theu fit perfectly and we received different designs so that we'd be able to differentiate the masks. My only cons were that when first put on there is a chemical odor so they were washed immediately. Another challenge is the breathing. It may be because it isn't 100% cotton or because we are just not used to wearing masks yet. My eldest son does say that he has no issues breathing through the mask. All in all it gives me peace of mind that we are doing our part during this pandemic. We have the camo, dark red, navy and skull.

When purchased, each of them were prime and we received them within a few days. The camo one came with a few other items but when that package arrived the mask was missing. Amazon refunded it right away and I was able to purchase another camo immediately and it came within 2 days. Amazing customer service!",Canada,2020-06-23
3,On the small side,"Well made solid facemask but Unfortunately on the smaller side. A regular surgical mask provided more coverage, while this mask i feel for its size would better suit children instead of adults.",Canada,2020-05-26
5,Finally - glasses don't fog!,"I've been trying a variety of masks - and bought these in navy. I ordered just two, to try them out.

I like them so much that I am ordering more. These come with a nose wire to make sure the mask fits properly, but more importantly - they are the first masks that I've tried that don't slide down my face or clog up my glasses.

They look good too!

I would highly recommend these, especially if you are having trouble with masks not fitting close enough to avoid the dreaded eyeglass fog.

These fit well, look good and are one of the better cloth masks I've tried.",Canada,2020-06-26
5,Would Recommend for Daily Use (comfy),"Comfortable, easy to breathe. Nose clip isn't very strong but it stays up just fine. Adjustable straps worked to tighten which is awesome. Color is beautiful. Love the shape, and the little mask filters I bought separately fit good in the mask and don't bother my breathing at all. Would recommend.",Canada,2020-07-22
5,SOFT FABRIC FACE MASK,"Buy Canadian, get your delivery in couple of days. Good quality face masks of soft material, well paclaged. Highly recommended.",Canada,2020-05-22
5,So much better then paper ones. 5‚≠ê,"So I decided to buy some masks a few months ago.
Typical black cloth style u see everywhere.
Wht i didn't realize is they were coming from China. My bad. All on me this one.
I should have dug a lil deeper into it.

So I did find a 3 pack. Purchased them.
Its been almost 2 months & nothing.
Tracking info hasn't changed yet.

So a few weeks ago I was browsing through & considering Covid-19 isn't going anywhere fast at all.
I decided to look at some again , now this time I only looked for masks on prime , as long as it comes from Amazon I'll buy them. I'm confident in there service.

I saw these masks made in Canada üá®üá¶ ...
I'm Canadian , who better to trust Eh. Lol.
Great design, they fit well & can be adjusted for a child if u forget ur kids at home or something like that.
Size adjustable..
They come in different patterns, have a filter insert built into it.
They have filters , sold separately of course. So make sure u get filters as well otherwise it's thin material & superior protection isn't assured u could say.
Filters aren't super expensive either.
50 pack is 20$ ..
I got a 10 pack the first time just to check them out.
I'll review filters soon.
Filters seem good & they fit the mask well enough. There is space that allows the filter to move around so u may need to adjust from time to time.
So far they seem solid , I've had one for a week now & its held up well so far.
Mind u I don't wear it out on the construction site.
I have disposable ones for that.
For in & out of offices, Restaurants, Groceries , Doctor's appointments, Gas stations, Those types of things I believe it works well for.
Well made , I feel like my money was well spent.

Only thing I think is off about these masks is the price.
Depending on pattern, price changes.
Just so u know.
If the price is to stay's the same , I can live with in the end of all this. Because really all I'm after is protecting my family & myself from Covid-19 , ALONG with every other person who purchases one of these masks or more. I purchased 5 masks already & 60 filters.
Add the first filter along with the mask.
Don't tell me as a company that isn't a great way to sell more masks.
It just makes sense.
Sell the customer the full product the first time & most likely they buy more.
Think about it.

Amazon
Superior service on this. Wow. 5‚≠êplus.
Thx u.

Weddingstar
Great product üá®üá¶ , 5‚≠ê
Think about it , add the first filter with the mask.",Canada,2020-07-19
1,Too Small!,"I ordered adult and got masks that do not fit myself or my wife.

They are very small, tight, and difficult to breathe through.

Painful to wear on the ears because of size.

I used them for all of 3 days before buying new masks from another source.",Canada,2020-08-05
5,Good quality mask. Does the job.,"These were the second masks i decided to try out for my family. So far were very pleased with them. We can all breath easily in them and they fit quite nicely on my wife and the kids one fits on my daughter nicely. For myself the straps around the ears hurt a bit after 20min of use so i took the rubber adjustments off and it actually fit and felt better. I like the option of filters but we weren't looking for that feature with these so that was a bonus. I‚Äôve hand washed one and let it air dry and it came out perfectly fine. I‚Äôd recommend these. They are a great, cheap option if you dont want the standard flimsy blue and white surgical masks you see everywhere these days.",Canada,2020-07-20
5,Best one for me.,"I have purchased and used a few different brand of masks now, but went back and ordered more of these ones.
The material is light making it comfortable breathing and you have an pocket to add a filter if you chose to.
No discomfort around the ears and straps are adjustable. I also appreciated the bendable wire to fit the mask around my nose for a nice fit. The price was reasonable. My adult children also all ordered these ones after seeing mine and the selection the have.",Canada,2020-07-22
1,These are not 3-Ply Masks as advertised,"These Morningstar masks are advertised as 3-Ply masks. They are 2 ply with a pocket for a filter. The material is a very thin cotton and although the measurements are given, they are no where near the size they look in the picture. We are extremely unhappy with these. Not what we expected from Amazon. We would like a refund, however when trying to return these, it says they are not returnable. However, no where did we see that when we purchased them. We ordered 2 other Morningstar masks and were able to return them, why not these?",Canada,2020-11-22
1,One more thing about this mask,"This mask does not come with the filters, you have to buy them separately. What good is it to sell a mask without the filters!!!",Canada,2020-06-16
5,Comfort and affordability,"It is easy to wear and doesn't fog up my glasses like paper masks do. The mask is well made and is comfortable to wear. I have purchased another one. The cons are that once you put the filter in, the mask becomes hot to wear with the filter in place for a long period of time. The solution is I will wear it on cooler days. The other issue is it needs hand washing. I like the mask overall and the price is right",Canada,2020-08-17
4,Happy with these masks,"I have read the other reviews for this type of mask and it depends on what you are looking for. Having spent a lot of time in and out of hospitals over the years, I did not want to use a mask that looked like a medical one. Now that face coverings are mandatory in many inside places, these offer adequate protection with the filter and with a variety of patterns, you can mix it up with your wardrobe. It has been sweltering hot lately and these are not as big and heavy as other masks I have seen people wear. I am very pleased with these masks and have purchased several in different patterns. The only down side is that they run a little on the small side for an adult male.",Canada,2020-07-08
5,Love this mask!,"This is my favourite of all the masks I've bought so far. It fits perfectly and is comfortable.
The only issue I had was that when I ordered it, Amazon's product info said that it was machine washable but when it arrived, it came with instructions that said it must be washed by hand. (Amazon has since corrected their info.) I probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd had the right info, because somehow it doesn't feel like hand washing can disinfect the way the washing machine does. I've solved the issue by hand washing and then leaving it for several days before I wear it again. Thing is, I like it so much that I will probably order a few more regardless of the washing issue.",Canada,2020-11-12
4,Nice,"A bit annoying to wear with my glasses (they keep sliding off my face) and somewhat hard to breathe in BUT I won't be running any marathons with the mask on... or off for that matter. Haha The delivery was quick considering there is a high demand, about a week for me just waiting for it to be shipped, but once it was, the next day it was here. The quality is good... So, overall, I'm happy and will be buying masks from these guys and gals in the future. Thanks.",Canada,2020-06-05
4,a decent cloth mask,"It's an alright mask which I still use to this day. I have a small face, so the one-size aspect kind of made it look big on me, but I guess its better than being too small. Plus it seems to do a good job covering the overall mouth/jaw region tightly. I noticed after you hand-wash it (which is recommended every time after use), it becomes REALLY wrinkly and not as smooth as it was first received/packaged. I tried to smooth it out with a steamer, but it still had prominent wrinkles throughout. I ordered the pink colored mask, where the wrinkles were very obvious when worn. Overall, I recommend to anyone who's interested in getting this mask to go for the darker colors so the wrinkles are not too obvious. The pros of this product are the adjustable straps which feel nice, and the included pocket for reusable filters.",Canada,2020-08-30
3,Wouldn't buy again,They are too small from top to bottom,Canada,2020-05-29
3,If I was to buy another mask it would not be this brand,"The other comments about the mask being small, difficult to breathe through, and uncomfortable are to a certain degree true. The mask does seem to work but there is no way I could wear it for a prolonged period of time. I find it too uncomfortable.",Canada,2020-07-01
2,Very very small fit. Only possible wearer would be a child,Masks a very small. Wouldn‚Äôt not fit a man. According to the pictures I thought it would be larger. Very hard to get it to sit on your nose and stay on your chin. The straps also pull your ears forward so mask could not be worn for a significant amount of time.,Canada,2020-06-29
5,Perfect mask,"I LOVE this mask, i had bought one from fb market place and it would not sit on my face properly, always cause my glasses to fog up, and it wasn‚Äôt adjustable, and it was the same price as this. This one, is AMAZING, i wear it everyday (obviously after washing it & drying it) and it‚Äôs still in a brand new condition. I wear it to work for 5-8 hours straight and forget i have it on sometimes tbh. AND it doesn‚Äôt fog up my glasses and doesnt hurt my ears!!! I got the navy one because it‚Äôs prime and it‚Äôs perfect bc it doesnt mess up my outfits (for all my fashionistas out there).",Canada,2020-10-05
1,Can‚Äôt breathe!,"This mask is super suffocating. I could not breathe and when I did it sucked the fabric right up against my face (I‚Äôm not that heavy of a breather) it also fogs up my glasses big time.
It fits my face just fine but it always feels like it‚Äôs one movement away from falling off.
Disappointed and sticking with the disposable masks from now on.",Canada,2020-07-08
4,Some issues but overall it‚Äôs okay.,"Love the different patterns that Weddingstar has to offer. The ear loops are adjustable and very easy on my sensitive ears, no pain after my 9 hour shifts. The nose strip is okay, doesn‚Äôt hold the mask super close to the nose, but compared to other masks it‚Äôs average. My only complaints are that at the seam that runs down the centre of the mask the ‚Äúextra‚Äù material that is inside the layers, sticks up and makes the mask stick out a bit, not a big deal. And the inner layer of fabric bunches up a lot, that‚Äôs my big issue with the mask.",Canada,2020-11-27
1,I'll keep looking,Unfortunately this mask is pretty small. If you have a small face it could potentially works for you. Other major dislike is that it states it has a nose wire however when you try to bend it doesn't stay in place at all. It does not fit around the nose so air comes out the top into your eyes. The wire is super weak and doesn't contour to the face. Was excited to try all the other awesome designs but I will have to keep looking for a fun mask.,Canada,2020-08-12
5,Good mask,"Nice mask. My first time i bought it came as a three pack. I went to order more then it was switched to only single masks.

I would have ordered more the first time but I wasn't sure how the quality would be.

Make packs again!
Also would be nice if they included filters with purchase instead of having to buy separate.",Canada,2020-07-19
4,A decent Face Mask!,"It fits well with the metal nosepiece and adjustable straps at the back. Its 2 ply with an insert to put in a filter or a piece of cloth for the added 3rd play. It does the job and looks decent. I'm happy I bought them for my wife and I. If you have found this review to be helpful, please let me know. Thanks.",Canada,2020-07-29
4,It‚Äôs really good,It‚Äôs not as bad as the reviews portray them. They do need filters and they‚Äôre a little bit small but 100% better than other useless masks that I bought that were literally for little kids it couldn‚Äôt fit me while they offered 3-6 masks it was still small so none of them were useful it was a waste of money but I bought 2 of these masks and they work just fine. I love the black with flower print because it‚Äôs big and fits my face perfectly. The navy Blue is a little small but still covers mouth and nose well,Canada,2020-07-07
3,Filters were totally missing,"I‚Äôm kind of disappointed, it said it came with filters but it came with zero. Absolutely none. It is light as a feather very thin. However, out of two different brands I bought, this one was the most comfortable. But because there‚Äôs no filters, I‚Äôm going to permanently sew in a layer of cotton to make it thicker, and then I don‚Äôt have to worry about filters, I can just wash it over and over again.",Canada,2020-08-10
3,Disappointed,"We saw the strong reviews for this product so we decided to order 4 for the family. One was the Black floral print. Not only was the colour of the floral print washed out /faded but the print itself was not properly aligned and part of the print was actually cut off the side of the mask. We also ordered a grey one which did not have the elastic band properly sewn in. The first time i went to put it on, the elastic strap tore away from the mask. I expected better",Canada,2020-08-22
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT (UNBREATHABLE),"I rarely write reviews but this mask disappointed me and my girl friend very much! I bought them because I saw many good reviews. I just think that I need to write something true and you should take it as a reference. Every time after using the mask, I wash them by hand very carefully and let them dry by themselves, however they become very wrinkled after several times' washing. The main problem is that it is too difficult for me to breathe when wearing it, the material is made of real cotton but not breathable enough as a wearing mask. Wearing a disposable mask is much much more comfortable than wearing this. I bought one for myself and one for my girl friend, both of us feel uncomfortable in breathing when wearing it, especially when we were talking to people or wearing a little bit longer like 20 minutes in store. Also, the price is too high for what I got. For the similar quality, I can buy three with the same price. I would recommend doing more research before buying this product.",Canada,2020-10-23
1,"Glasses fog, very hot and hard to breathe comfortably.","I was hopeful for this mask based on what I read. Sadly my glasses fogged immediately and the material was thick enough to make it hot and hard to breathe. I would prefer to wear a disposable mask over this. The quality seemed great, it‚Äôs just not comfortable or particularly breathable fabric.",Canada,2020-07-04
2,A tight fit for adults!,"I bought a kids and adult sized masks. When I lay them on top of each other, they were exactly the same size. Ear loop lengths were the same as well! This mask fit ok for me since I have a small face, however it was pretty tight for my husband. Also, the material is quite thin. The lining is nearly see through. Overall, they were fairly disappointing. Kudos to Amazon for shipping them in one day though!",Canada,2020-06-20
3,Essential Apparel,"The Lone Ranger rides again! This is a relatively overpriced mask that accepts matching 'filters'. It shares one major shortcoming that all masks do for glass wearers. Eye glass fog. As a result, while I'm being responsible health wise, I'm often blinded in-store. Ideas anyone? Amazon?",Canada,2020-07-11
2,Too small for a mans face,"I should have listened to the reviews before purchasing these. The fit is too small for a mans face. I purchased 3 different colours and all 3 fit the same. Doesn't sit under the chin. Not good protection. Would be okay for a smaller face. The material is a good quality, but fit isn't good.",Canada,2020-12-08
4,Good quality but not designed for average / larger male faces,Well made mask. Good stitching and washes well. Inside pocket very useful for purchased filters or coffee filters. Adult masks fit my wife and teens well but too short in the vertical direction for an average male face. If you try to talk with the mask on it either pulls off your nose or comes up from under your chin. Could use another inch in the vertical direction. Would be great if the company offered a larger size taking this into consideration. Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the size issue.,Canada,2020-07-15
2,Too small for an adult woman,"Material is nice, but it fits very small. It‚Äôs great that it‚Äôs adjustable, but if it‚Äôs too small when it‚Äôs set as long as it can go it isn‚Äôt very useful.",Canada,2020-06-15
5,perfect for men.,"Purchased the navy blue for my husband as masks are now mandatory in my city. the adult size fit him perfectly where as they are too big for me and i had to go to a kids size.
Excellent thickness, I don't think filters are even necessary,since it passes the flame test without, but there is a pouch for filters.",Canada,2020-07-25
5,Good as it gets.,"Just got this and it's about as good as you'll get for a reusable mask. You can put additional filters in it but it didn't come with any. Is the adult size small? Not for me, fits perfect. I'm glad I ordered 2.",Canada,2020-06-12
2,"Too small, hard to breath","This is not adult sized, I don't have a large face but it barely fits and pulls my ears. Also it is not easy to breath in it, it gets hot so fast and your face starts to sweat especially during summer, it is not something people can use outdoors.",Canada,2020-06-29
4,Light and practical,"I purchased a dozen of these masks so far and will be buying more for myself and kids. I would recommend the Adult sized for a child 10 years plus as the child's size is too small. I love everything about this mask, especially the access to the pocket to add a filter. I think it's really important to add a filter of some sort for added protection. The only thing I would change in the design of this mask is to make it a bit wider from ear to ear to increase coverage. That said, I am still content with wearing this mask (with a filter).",Canada,2020-09-07
5,Must have.,"I love these. They feel soft, and I can add in my filters no problems for that extra protection. I wish them every time I go out (once a week). The material holds up, its easy to wear for a few hours without any discomfort. Definitely recommend for everyone.",Canada,2020-08-26
3,Ok .,"I give it 3 star because the title said it'll come with filters so I bought it BUT mine just came with the mask so it is a bit deceiving. People said it's small , yes it is on the smaller size.

The missing 2 star reason
1. Did not come with filter
2. Bit pricey if there no filter and bit small but still wearable.",Canada,2020-06-17
2,Not big enough for a large person,"I ordered this mask because most masks pull my ears forward. I thought the adjusters meant that this one would be better. I ended up pulling the adjusters off completely, and the loops were still too short. I had to stretch the entire mask aggressively to be able to use it. Not worth the price.",Canada,2020-10-05
4,REASONABLE MASK,The mask is thick enough and passes the candle blow out test. It shrinks a bit after washing. It could be larger to ensure full coverage of the nose and mouth and wrap around the face. The shrinkage makes it awkward to insert the filters.,Canada,2020-08-26
1,Far too small for my adult face. Good quality but sizing is wrong.,Good quality 3 layer mask. The option for the filter is nice. The mask is well built however it is much too small and barely stays over my chin. Other similar masks I own fit much tighter to my face. I do not recommend this mask for the average sized adult. It's much better suited to smaller people or children.,Canada,2021-02-03
3,"Too small, def not for even an average guy.","Too small, I am an average male and it's too small.

For all who want a point of reference - it's about 1 inch shorter in height than regular doctor masks, so it only covers your nose and mouth- does not actually hug your chin= lots of places for non filtered air to run.

If you are a guy dont buy it. If you are a guy with 5mm+ beard definitely don't buy it.",Canada,2020-07-20
5,Comfortable and easy to breathe through,"First washable mask that I can stand on my face longer than 30 minutes. Unlike cotton ones I have used, these stay dry and comfortable. While it was not an issue for me, the elastic adjustable straps are helpful but they may not adjust enough for someone with a larger head. (I wear a 7 3/8 cap or medium ballcap). That said, try one. You will be satisfied with your purchase.",Canada,2020-09-02
5,Very comfortable and fits well,Great mask and great quality. Adjustable nose piece. The only con would be that they are a little hard to breath in but that is because they are good quality cloth. I purchased a second one for my boyfriend and I so clearly they are worth it lol,Canada,2020-07-28
4,Overall well-done and I am happy with the purchase.,"Mask is ok, well stitched and comfortable. My only disappointment was that the pocket was a bit too wide for the filter and so, the filter was moving up and down and you have to always make sure filter is positioned on your nose. But perhaps, the filters are made too narrow... Either way, mask itself is made well, i just wished filter fit a bit better.",Canada,2020-09-27
1,Hard to breath,"As a Transit Operator who has to wear a face mask at least 8 hours a day. I found it noticeably harder to breath in comparison to other face masks. Feel, construction is great just the material is too thick.",Canada,2020-12-13
5,Easy to Use,"I bought this mask for my husband and he likes it. He wears it every time he goes out with no problem at all; however, he had to shave his beard back close to his face. Also, he hand-washed the mask and let it drip dry resulting in a mask which was ready to go again. Good value and more importantly he wears it!",Canada,2020-07-06
1,Mask too Small,"Just received this mask in the mail. I accidentally ordered Navy instead of black - that's my bad, but the mask it's self is tiny. It covers my nose but does not sit under my chin like the photos suggest, it sits on the curve of my chin so as soon as I speak or smile the thin pops up to below my chin. Giving it 1 star because it arrived so quickly.",Canada,2020-08-14
4,Tight Mask,The mask works good and definitely straps good around your face. But after wearing for a while it pushes hard against your nose which makes it uncomfortable. This also fogs up my glasses sometimes. I would go for a larger mask next time.,Canada,2020-08-01
2,Not a mask for the adult male,"I ordered two of these, but when I got them I found they're quite small. Just barely covered from the tip of my nose to the point of my chin. If I talked either it slid off my nose or up from my chin. Not very comfortable to wear and doesn't seem to stretch at all. Luckily they fit my wife just fine. Be aware if you're an adult male it may not fit you properly. Very disappointing purchase.",Canada,2020-11-15
2,Inconsistent Sizing,"I bought one of these and I loved it, so I ordered a few more. The sizing is crazy on these. The first one fits perfectly. The other four are all totally different sizes and all too big. I might be able to modify them myself to fit properly, but overall I'm pretty unimpressed.",Canada,2020-09-30
2,"Comfortable, but suffocating","This mask is adjustable and fits well. However, it is made of a few layers of very light material, which causes it to suction right up against the nostrils and mouth when inhaling, creating that awful suffocating feeling.",Canada,2020-11-25
1,"Do not buy, not worth the money, too small, it's dark blue not even black;","the whole product is a lie lol, it's a kid mask, it's dark blue, its really hard to breath through this bc of how ridiculous small and thick it is... do yourself a favor and look for a different mask. medical masks not made of tissue are ten times better than this.",Canada,2020-07-24
5,Easy to wear and breathe in,Mask was easy to wear. Son had a black one given to him for his workplace. One day he had left his behind and asked to use one of ours. He never returned it and asked if I would order him another one üòä,Canada,2020-09-25
1,Small and not breathable,"The mask is really small. I'm 5'1 with a small head and this mask barely covers my face. Because it's so small, the material presses right against my nose and mouth leaving no room to breath. The outside material on the mask is some plasticy synthetic fabric which isn't breathable and gets hot almost immediately.

Save your money and wrap a bandana around your face instead. It'll be more comfortable.",Canada,2020-08-26
5,Nice Fit!!!,"Love these masks! Got one just to try it out because most masks tend to fit weird, and I love it and!!!!! I ended up buying the entire family one (5 of us) and recommending them to friends. Super nice! The ear elastics are adjustable, and there's a pocket for filters if desired!! LOVE these!",Canada,2020-08-09
3,Nose piece isn't strong enough,"The mask is pretty comfy if not wearing glasses, but the nose piece is a very thin wire that doesn't hold it's shape. As soon as I bend it to shape around my nose it just bends back straight, useless if you're wearing glasses. The ear loops are also very small, I've had to take off the adjusters just to make the mask fit comfortably. I'm a woman with a normal sized head.",Canada,2020-09-24
3,To Small for an average size adult male,They are too small for an average size male. If I open my mouth to talk it falls off my nose or comes up from under my chin. It needs to have a bit more play in the fit so that you can actually move your mouth. Other than that is appears well made. It is 3-ply and with an added filter obviously the airflow is restricted somewhat. I would not want to workout in it.,Canada,2020-11-13
3,Nice but..,"It looks nice honestly but after about an hour of wearing its difficult to breathe and I tend to get a headache.

However I think that's just the price you pay for wearing a decent looking mask.

Worth it",Canada,2020-07-17
1,Don't buy this,"Ordered 2, thinking they came in packs of 3 at least. Refuse to open up the second one. Horrible product. Extremely thin. No filter included, you have to buy that separate. Way to expensive for such a thin mask which is impossible to breathe through. Don't waste your money",Canada,2020-07-21
2,Size made too smll,"Ordered an additional ""adult"" size mask in this color but seems was made a little smaller and isn't the same size as previous ones. Make sure u get what you order.!",Canada,2020-07-24
5,Fits well!,"I think if we have to wear a mask this is as comfortable as it gets for me, fits well, cute prints, no complaints!",Canada,2020-07-19
5,This is the mask you are looking for,"This mask is comfortable, functional and even stylish. Excellent quality materials and it has a ""pouch"" area inside if you want to insert an extra filter.

Highly recommended and I would definitely buy again.",Canada,2020-07-23
1,Not for an adult,This is for a child. To small. Not as described in description for size,Canada,2020-07-29
4,Well made but definitely fits small,"Well made.. But definitely fits small. I bought 3 different ones and they are all different sizes. 2 fit my wife perfectly but the navy colour fits like a childs mask and I had to remove the adjustment beads from the straps because it's just too tight.
I don't recommend for men.",Canada,2020-07-20
5,"As expected! Comfortable & light, love the nose wire","Exactly what I expected. Good size for a woman, and the nose wire is a great addition to keep it stuck to your face as much as possible. Light weight fabric & easy to clean, has held up to many washings now. Thank you!

For a man, I would recommend to others to get a different mask in a larger size however.",Canada,2020-09-30
4,Pas adapt√© si vous portez des lunettes,"Vraiment pas confortable pour quelqu‚Äôun qui porte des lunettes, car le m√©tal √† l‚Äôint√©rieur accroche √† la hauteur des lunettes. Autrement, sans lunette, rien √† redire.",Canada,2020-08-21
3,Fit on small faces better,"I found them (I ordered 4 in total, different colours) but found them to be on the small side. One of them the ear strap broke first time used but I restitched it. Not meant for bigger faces. Two came in one delivery, and the other 2 in a different delivery even though all made by same company and 2 had a delivery charge and the other 2 did not.",Canada,2020-07-18
3,This product did not fit well,"I bought this for my husband and son, but it did not fit well. Although I bought the larger size, the package did not show the size. Very disappointing.",Canada,2021-01-23
2,Very small,"Clearly made for a small head and face. Didn't need the adjuster, made the loops too tight, and if you open you mouth a touch it slips off your nose or chin. Just ordered a 60 pack of filters before trying it on. Should be a good fit for a small child.",Canada,2020-08-27
3,Smaller in size but comfortable,"Even the adult sizes are somewhat small! I have a smaller face, but these almost don't fit me. If you have a larger or longer face, these might not fit!

The adjustable ear straps are comfortable, they're easy to wash (I machine wash and air dry them), and fairly comfortable overall. Easy to put a filter in.",Canada,2020-08-15
2,Adult Size too small,"The mask isn't bad, but even the adult size was too small for me (male) to be particularly effective. and the filters don't fit in particularly well (They were much smaller than the mask pocket itself, so they aren't too effective). As an ""only option"" early in the pandemic it was suitable, but with the many other options available I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",Canada,2020-11-12
5,Fantastic mask & great fit,Perfect fit. The adjustable elasticized bands make this mask so easy to customize the fit & the wired top is great for securing a snug fit around my nose.,Canada,2020-08-02
3,Good shape. Inside fabric loose,"Face mask has a good shape. Like the nose piece with wire so can fit to nose, also adjustable ear straps were good.

What I didn‚Äôt like about it is the fabric on the inside was loose and so when you would inhale the fabric would stick to your nose and mouth.",Canada,2020-08-24
3,made small,i bought adult size but it's small for me as a woman. i would have liked it to be a bit bigger. it's well made but thats about all i can say for it.,Canada,2020-07-02
5,Well-made mask,"These aren't the heaviest-duty masks, but they are comfortable to wear, well constructed, and available in a nice range of colours and patterns.",Canada,2020-09-16
5,Honestly the best masks i've boughten,"I have now bought at least 10 of these masks in different colours and patterns for myself, my family and friends. I love how many styles there are for expression. These masks are durable, easy to breathe in, and the straps DO NOT hurt your ears - which is a huge win. The price point in reasonable and they are a great buy!",Canada,2020-09-26
2,"Smelly mask, too small for adults","The mask is way too small for an adult. It's WAY TOO TIGHT, to the point that will pull down your ears.
The mask i got smelled like onions and curryüò†. I wonder if they send me an used maskü§Æ",Canada,2020-07-13
5,Covid 19 makes mask a fashion accessory,"So global pandemic. When masks became mandatory in all public areas, ordered three masks. Didnt know how good quality these were until I had to wear a spare cheap mask. This is a Cadillac.",Canada,2020-07-26
1,Worst mask I‚Äôve ever purchased.,I ordered because it said it was a large and I have a beard. It wouldn‚Äôt even fit my face if I didn‚Äôt have a beard. If I place it to the bottom of my chin (not beard) it touches my nose but does not cover it. It‚Äôs the worst fitting mask I currently own and didn‚Äôt feel nice behind the ears at all. Super rough. Total waste,Canada,2020-11-18
5,"Really great product, after several washes","Buying re-usable masks, I was concerned that they wouldn't be usable after a few washes, but these are so well made they are as good as new even after several washes! Not too heavy, the filters fit perfectly.

Solid product",Canada,2020-06-23
5,Good quality,"Nice cotton masks and shipped very quickly. I'm 5'8"" & my wife is 5'3"" and the mask fits perfectly. If you are larger than this, think twice as this may be too small for you.",Canada,2020-06-17
5,Protection,Tres confortable et pas trop chaud. Respire correctement. Bien construit avec bande √©lastique ajustable et aussi renfort pour le nz,Canada,2020-07-29
4,Good,"This face mask is pretty good, the unfortunate part is that the picture shows the mask being black. I didn't read properly and thought it was the black one instead of the navy. My boyfriend still likes it though.",Canada,2021-02-02
1,Not breathable,"The mask looks nice but that's about it. The mask was not very breathable, it felt uncomfortably difficult to breath in these and that was without even using a filter with it, so I imagine using a filter would be even harder to breath.
I ended up throwing it in the bin as its just not feasible to actually use.",Canada,2020-11-10
3,Not great for an everyday mask,Difficult to breathe through as the lining isn't stitched tight to the outer layer and goes in your nose when breathing. My mask significantly shrunk after the 1st wash. Fit is good and comfortable and it stays in place. Great color selection which is good if you need a specific color for an outfit.,Canada,2020-09-23
1,Waste of money,"Too small, the measurements in the image don't match the actual mask dimensions. The metal nose bridge is uncomfortable.",Canada,2020-11-18
3,"Nose wire not stiff enough, difficult to instal filter","Lightweight mask with adjustable elastic which is a good feature. However, the nose wire is too soft and cannot mold to your nose and it is very difficult to instal a paper filter. After I glued in a stiffer nose wire to close tightly around my nose the mask worked well.",Canada,2020-08-22
3,expensive,"Ive realized after months of using this facemask that this is very expensive. I was able to order 2 mask pack for less than this price and they look
exactly the same.",Canada,2020-08-06
2,Hard to Breathe and fogs glasses,"The nose wire isnt adjustable and is too flat to lock my breath from fogging up my glasses.
It's too thick even without a filter which makes it difficult to breathe.",Canada,2020-07-14
5,Masked for style and saftety,I bought 3 differently designed masks for my family no one will mistake each other‚Äôs mask. I love that they can be washed and reused.,Canada,2020-07-13
2,Small,"Size is very small. I‚Äôm male not a large face, fit is small. Cannot wear to a degree that offers any protection. Cannot return. However it appears to be of quality construction. Need a size range for different people.",Canada,2020-11-24
2,Ok,They shrink if put into the dryer. Otherwise I like them but I don‚Äôt like how breathtaking is so restrictive,Canada,2021-02-04
5,Perfect fit,Perfect fit and very affordable. I will buy some more of these for sure. I have a beard and it fits perfect.,Canada,2021-01-28
2,Small,States it is an adult size mask but it‚Äôs too small. We ordered two adult masks the one for my wife was perfect but mine is too small. Even for a regular face I ain‚Äôt even fat.,Canada,2020-06-22
2,Not for Adult Males,My Husband found this mask to small. The sides of the Mask didn‚Äôt come across the sides of his face or under his chin enough. They don‚Äôt fit as seen in the picture for adult male because young female models are used. The Nose clip and quality of material was good.,Canada,2020-07-29
2,Inner layer sticks to your face,"After it's been washed a few times the material loosens and when you breath in it sticks to your face, making it difficult to breath.",Canada,2020-12-10
5,Finally a mask that fits my face!,"I have a small face bit this mask fit me perfectly, and doesn't fog up my glasses so much. But if you have a beard or a bigger face this mask may not work for you.",Canada,2020-06-14
1,Garbage product,Absolute garbage.... Unless you're into not being able to breath and your ears being pulled into a comical clown like position,Canada,2020-07-09
1,Mask is no good.,The mask is very uncomfortable now as it shrunk after initial wash! Does not provide the sellers advertised protection.,Canada,2020-07-19
3,They‚Äôre ok,"Fogs up my glasses and not large enough for my face, fits my wife but fogs up her glasses as well.",Canada,2020-08-09
5,Good Mask and Nice fit,"Found the mask to fit very comfortably and has adjustment to tighten or loosen around your ears. Also has slot for filter as well. Easy to hand wash without noticing any issue to the material. No issues to date, highly recommend.",Canada,2020-08-26
3,Fits very small then shrinks,They fit very small they're perfect for a child say under 12 or a small adult. However once they've been washed they shrink and they are very very small now. Pretty sure they didn't use pre-shrunk fabric.,Canada,2020-06-21
5,Good mask for price,"I read some reviews that mentioned this mask was too small and would only fit for a child. I think this mask fits perfectly for an adult. It is extremely comfortable and adjustable. I find it easy to breathe as well. I would recommend this product, it is a great price and came in 2 days!",Canada,2020-06-11

5,Great value. Very comfortable.,Great product. I was them on the gentle cycle and hang them to dry. I use the filter in them. Comfortable. Adjustable at the ears. Bought several.,Canada,2020-12-30
3,It is hard to breath wearing the mask,"The mask is a bit small for my face. It doesn‚Äôt fully cover the parts of the face that it should cover. It also doesn‚Äôt allow for breathing. It is hard to breath while wearing it, specially in hot days. Otherwise I like it. I bought two. So I use one and after use wash it. And always have one extra.",Canada,2020-06-09
5,Comfortable!!!,"I purchased one to try out and bought a few more afterwards. I have recommended it to several of people who have purchased them as well. They are light weight, comfortable, and very breathable. Quick delivery, would recommend to anyone looking for a mask.",Canada,2020-07-15

Not able to use",Canada,2020-06-20

5,Masques lavables,Tr√®s confortables. En ai donn√© en cadeau. M√™me appr√©ciation que moi. Bon choix.,Canada,2020-07-28
5,Quality as well as lightweight,Quality is great. Light and breathable. I did find a little pricey as they were $14.99. Would like to see around $10 as this is the going rate with my local stores with similar quality. Would purchase again.,Canada,2020-08-05
5,Very comfortable,"There are fantastic, breathable and fit well. Only complaint is they wrinkle quickly after they are washed.",Canada,2020-09-01
4,Couvre bien le visage,"Facile d entretient couvre bien le visage juste un peu de difficult√© √† respirer apr√®s un certain temps.
Mon conjoint le porte aussi.j‚Äôavais peur qui soit trop petit vu les commentaires que j‚Äôavais lu mais il est parfait",Canada,2020-08-01
5,Love love love these,I wear them for hors at work and I love them super comfy and fit nicely to my face. Sometimes it can hurt your ears for long periods of time but I think that's normal. Love these though I bought 1 and then bought more after.,Canada,2020-11-05
2,Quality is decent,A little on the pricey side. downside is that you have to purchase filters separately.,Canada,2020-06-14
3,Well constructed but on the small size,"These are well made and the adjustable tab is great, but as adult size, they don't seem to fit any of the men in our household. I would definitely appreciate it if Weddingstar came out with a larger size.",Canada,2020-06-20
1,didnt last long,wore it three times and the ear band broke. could try gluing it I suppose.,Canada,2020-09-10
4,Good basic mask,Great product overall. Material is sturdy and lots of fit options. Nose bridge wire could be improved to better fit face to prevent slipping. I bought it in black and reordered for my boyfriend in navy.,Canada,2020-08-21
5,Face mask,This mask is very well made and excellent quality...the only issue I had was from the pictures it looked to be a larger size which was what I was looking for but it runs on the smaller size. So if you have a smaller face than this mask would be perfect.,Canada,2020-09-07
1,The inside is white,"I thought it would be navy blue inside the mask as well. Instead it‚Äôs white, which is disappointing because you will see all the dirt right away.",Canada,2020-08-24

4,Nice mask,I didn't give it 5 stars because it is difficult to slip in the 3rd layer.,Canada,2020-12-01

3,Not the best value for your buck,"I'm not sure if this is classified as an adult size as this mask to too small and tight for my comfort.

2,What adult could wear this?,"I bought 2 of these. I can't imagine whose adult face these would fit. I have an average head size and like others have said, this is far too small from top to bottom and the longest length on the ear straps is just adequate.",Canada,2020-06-19
2,"What is this, a mask for ants?","It‚Äôs smaller than I expected, it won‚Äôt properly sit on my nose and chin. It doesn‚Äôt form a proper seal around the nose so it shoots air towards my eyes when I exhale. It might fit a young teenager or someone with a small face, if you have an adult sized head you might want to look for a different mask.",Canada,2020-09-09
3,Good Mask,Overall good but slightly bigger and longer loops would have been perfect.,Canada,2020-07-08
1,Only fits small faces,"Sizing is misleading, did not fit my average adult face, at all.",Canada,2020-08-11
5,Perfect fit!!,It fit perfectly.,Canada,2020-07-04
3,Runs small. Not for many adults.,I purchased the child size and adult size. The child size is for a toddler and the adult size is quite small and fits an older child or a small adult only.,Canada,2020-06-07
5,"Comfortably useful, supplied locally and delivered quickly","I found this to be a more comfortable mask than the disposables. It fits well, doesn't fog up my glasses while breathing, and has a space for reusable 5 layer filters. The disposables were so uncomfortable and created a problem with fogging my glasses while breathing, that I had to find an immediate replacement. After reading the specs on this mask and seeing bulk packages of replacement filters that fit it properly, I ordered both and they were delivered together by courier. It's nice to see that Amazon takes the necessity of these as so vital that they dispatch them quickly. The design is well done and should fit most people easily enough. If I had to be out in public more, I would have purchased two masks, but one is sufficient for my current requirements. The price on the mask and replacement filters was reasonable too, so I had no hesitation in ordering them. I was careful to check the supplier, as many of the similar cheaper ones ship from China. They would have taken too long to reach me! I definitely would recommend these to others looking for a solution to safety in this current crisis.",Canada,2020-09-15
1,Too Challenging to Wear,"Although the mask is comfortable on the face, it‚Äôs fairly bulky (thick) even without the filters. I suppose I should have read the description more carefully as I was surprised that I was required to purchase the filters separately. It‚Äôs unfortunate not even 1 filter was included. Then after receiving the filters, it‚Äôs not easy to insert them into the mask. And once inserted, the airflow was compromised and somewhat constricted. If I was able to return the product, I would have.",Canada,2021-02-03
1,Complete waste of money,"The mask itself is too small to fit an adult face properly. The filter (which isn't included) is even smaller than the mask, and covers maybe 75% of the interior. There are gaps between the sides of the nose that all air goes through instead of passing through the filter. The wire that's supposed to help with the fit around the nose is too thin, and doesn't hold shape at all. The shape of the mask, with the creases, also makes it obvious that it was sewn upside down. All in all, this mask will not protect you from anything. It's a complete waste of money.",Canada,2020-07-13
3,Masque lavable,"Ce masque ne couvre pas suffisamment (pas assez de tissu) le nez et bouche. C‚Äôest tout juste. Il est trop plaqu√© au visage, peu de place pour respirer. On dirait un masque pour enfant.
De plus, il ne vient avec aucun filtre. Il faut commander les filtres de carbon qui eux aussi ne couvrent pas l‚Äôensemble de la pochette int√©rieure.
Je suis donc d√©√ßue. Le rapport qualit√©-prix est tr√®s moyen.",Canada,2020-08-09
3,It's okay.,"The nose clip feels like it's plastic, rather than metal, so the seal is not good. If you wear glasses, I think that they would still fog up. The elastic that goes behind your ears is too tight for me, even when I adjusted it as loose as it goes. It pulls my ears forward. Disposable masks don't do that.
I decided to give the mask to my mom because of these two issues.",Canada,2020-07-23
5,Very good quality.,"Very good quality.
I've got a big head, and it does fit, but just. Will ride down a bit if I yap too much. Would probably benefit from a bit more substantial nose wire thingy. Bonus points for actually being a proper mask and not just a spit-shield. AND has the inner pocket for filter doodad's if it gets really bad out there!",Canada,2020-10-21
3,Not bad. Bit too snug.,"I just feel like it is too small for the face. I am a 6 foot 2, 250 pds, male. Too snug on the face. Tight around the ears on the largest setting. But I wear it and it fits, just not the most comfortably and I don‚Äôt like wearing it longer than the average grocery trip length. Good for women or smaller men.",Canada,2020-07-28
4,Well made - could be just a touch larger.,"Choice of materials, stitching and adjustable straps are all great.
My only complaint is that it is just a little small on my face (male 6',2""""). It's only a problem if I have to speak while wearing it at which point I have to constantly adjust it.
Otherwise. it sits comfortably.
I would expect that for the average woman's face that this would be a great choice.",Canada,2020-07-20
5,Well covered,"Fits well, especially with the adjustable ear loops. Comfortable and soft materials. It wouldn't be my hot day out mask as it is on the thinker side. Well made. Washed nicely in machine, cold, hang dried. It is recommended you hand wash by the manufacturer though. Overall happy with it.",Canada,2020-07-27
4,Little short but very nice.............,Really like my designs. I bought 3. Just find the chin dimension is a little short for me. Mainly because I wear glasses an I'm always pulling it up to the top of my nose so my glasses don't fog up. Either an extension at the nose or make the chin approximatley a half in longer. All an all I would recommend these.,Canada,2020-07-20
2,Not what I expected,Before you buy beware. We bought 2 of these and although they look good the size is small. I would understand for a man it could be small but for a women with a med face it fits small. Also it the ears although adjustable still fit tight and uncomfortable. I was going to return but you have to pay shipping back and that is almost 1/2 the cost of the mask. Disappointing :(,Canada,2020-07-08
2,Not machine washable - not practical,"Not machine washable - misleading description

We ordered 7 masks. They look great, but there was an insert in the packaging stating hand washing / air drying required. We‚Äôre a family of 5, and expecting to need to wash 10-15 masks a day. Can‚Äôt possibly hand wash them all daily.",Canada,2020-07-17
5,"Item description, picture and delivery not matching!",Something went wrong... the picture item is black... Navy delivered. Where as the blue item on route... is described as black. We have a black already... and the navy is not the pretty blue. The teens are fighting over the black... so if another delivered... it's üëå,Canada,2020-10-05
3,"Don‚Äôt loosen the straps too much, you won‚Äôt be able to fix it","I‚Äôve been wearing it for 8 hours a time at my job and I‚Äôve found it pretty comfortable to breathe through. I tried to adjust the ear straps to make it looser but when you pull them too far, the adjuster pops off and I can‚Äôt get them back on so I had to tie knots in the sides to make it fit which makes them hard on my ears.",Canada,2020-09-03
3,Nose wire is weak,"The masks are comfortable, my only problem is that the nose wire is soft and does not hold shape. I fit it to my nose and when I let go it opens up a bit and my glasses fog up. If the nose wire was more stiff and held shape to my nose than it would be a 4 star. If youbwesr glasses this mask won't work well for you",Canada,2020-07-26
3,"Flattens my nose, can‚Äôt wear for more than 15 minutes","I like how lightweight these are, and the adjustable elastic, but there is not enough room for my nose inside the mask, it feels like the tip of my nose is being pushed down. When i compare this mask to my other masks - the front curve is definitely a lot less convex.",Canada,2020-09-19
3,Fit,I bought 2 masks. I am disappointed with the polka dot one. It appears the lining is a bit smaller than the outer mask causing it to bunch a little making it uncomfortable to wear. The navy blue mask is fine. I also purchased filters and they fit inside fine.,Canada,2020-07-16
2,Faites attention aux articles NON inclut,"J'ai pris ce masque car je croyais que les filtres, les extensions et le petit sac √©taient inclut. Mais non, c'est bien √©crit sur la photo que ce n'est pas inclut mais je ne l'avais pas vu. C'est un peu trompeur.",Canada,2020-07-21
3,a bit uncomfortable to wear,"Double layered, I find the inside layer very loose which makes it harder to breathe without the fabric touching your nostrils. If they tightened up the inside layer of fabric people would still be able to put the filter inside. I also found it a bit small even for an average face",Canada,2020-11-28
2,Too thick to wear for very long,This is perfect for wearing in and out of a store. It's too thick for longer wear. It gets moist in the mouth area and you are practically eating it if you need to talk much.Would only buy again for a good sale price.,Canada,2020-09-27
2,Far too small for me,"These masks were far too small, the straps were not long enough to use. The quality seems good, however even after I completely removed the toggles for adjusting fit, the loops for my ears were so tight that they bent my ears and the mask slipped off.

Maybe good for children?",Canada,2020-06-26
3,Good quality - too bad it is on the small side,I ordered this for my husband and it's too small on him. I wish they sold an xl for men. It's a good quality mask. The large fits me im an average female but not my husband who is a big tall man.,Canada,2020-08-02
4,Decent,"Fairly lightweight, adjustable straps are nice, doesn't cover much more than mouth and nose (if that's what you're after) and i have a slim face. Would be tight if you're bigger.",Canada,2020-09-04
5,Good for continuous use,"Everything is excellent except the price!
May be because it is over-built, it has dust collection pocket as well.
It could be used for continuous use in dusty area.",Canada,2020-09-02
3,De bonne qualit√© mais.,"Ajustement au maximum des oreilles pour ne pas tirer les oreilles. Respiration assez bonne si on ne bouge pas trop , mais √† l'√©picerie l'air ne circulait pas bien le tissu se collait √† ma bouche et la respiration √©tait plus difficile.",Canada,2020-07-23
3,Good quality but bad measurements,"I ordered 1 adult and 3 kid sizes and each one has different measurements, even the 3 kids ones vary in sizes. The adult one is a bit small for a lady‚Äôs face. The fabric feels good on the skin but measurement a huge issue.",Canada,2020-07-12
5,Good item,"Pretty good masks. They have adjustable and elasticky ear loops for best fit. Mouth and nose have enough room when it feels good. Happy with my purchases, i got 2 masks.",Canada,2020-08-25
4,feels great,"fits great, feels good, comfortable, a bit on the smaller side, overall a great mask for the $$, but i see local stores are selling this brand for 2 dollars less.",Canada,2020-09-04
5,Great masks.,"I like these masks. They fit perfect.
I bought for my family and we are all set.",Canada,2020-06-04
5,Good face mask in these times.,It is good for protection of others if the wearer has the wish not to spread particles into the air to others.and filter air the wearer breaths. as long as worn properly.,Canada,2020-12-07
5,Ok,A little small and made in China. I wanted Canadian made. Not just sold buy a Canadian company.,Canada,2020-06-26
2,Poor quality,"These masks are very small. The material is good quality but the stitching isn‚Äôt.
I ended up buying better made ones by a local seller on Etsy for the same price.",Canada,2020-07-14
4,Ok Mask,"No nose wire, fit great if you have an average face (female and medium). Not fit so well for a grownup male with a wider face. Nice design and adjustable",Canada,2020-08-19
5,Runs small but otherwise good quality,Fits well if you have a smaller head/face. This would never fit my husband or even my 10 yo son who have rounder face shapes. Good quality though.,Canada,2020-10-04
5,Facile d‚Äôentretien il y a une armature pour le nez,Ce couvre-visage est parfait il couvre vraiment bien le menton et le nez il est confortable quand on parle √ßa ne se d√©place pas √† recommander,Canada,2021-01-28

5,Nice light comfortable mask,Bought this for my husband. He said it is light and comfortable. His glasses don't fog up and it folds up and fits in his Wallet.,Canada,2020-08-31
2,they shrink.,"The masks shrunk at least 1/2 in top to bottom after a couple of hand washes in cool water with very mild, (baby), bath soap.",Canada,2020-11-19
1,Meh,"Not a great mask, pretty thin and for someone with a bigger nose....even as loose as possible, it's extremely uncomfortable",Canada,2020-12-02
5,Great fit,"Unlike other masks, I found this to be comfortable, snug and a great fit. I also like that they had a variety to choose from.",Canada,2020-07-19
4,Good mask,Was hoping the nose piece would prevent my glasses from fogging but nope didn't work. Aside from that it's a good mask.,Canada,2020-09-10
1,Short around chin area.,The mask is a little small for average adult. Does not cover chin area as much as I think it should. It is good around nose area. It is adjustable on ears. But seems a little short around chin area.,Canada,2020-08-05
5,Excellent quality.,"This mask is excellent quality, it is comfortable to wear and my glasses don‚Äôt fog up when I wear it.",Canada,2020-11-30

4,Fit,"I like the weight of the mask and it's good breathing wise. The only negative is, I haven't been able to adjust it so it doesn't ride up. Too tight and it pulls on your ears, too loose and it rides up.",Canada,2020-09-19
4,On the small size,"Did not fit my husband, but they fit me so I have 2 more masks and he has only 1 that fits and not from this supplier.",Canada,2020-07-22
5,Fits nicely,I've tried a few masks. These fit comfortably with just the right amount of nose pinch. Large adult male.,Canada,2020-10-14
2,Too small for average North American adult male face,"These seem to be made to fit women or other people with small faces. Also, the ""wire"" in the nose is not stiff or long enough to create a good seal on the nose: these still fog up glasses.",Canada,2020-09-21
3,Not stitched properly,"This is the second one I ordered for work, and this one was not as well made. The stitching was not centered, so there was too much fabric on one side of my face. Thankfully, the ear straps are adjustable.",Canada,2020-07-09
4,Nice mask but smaller than shown,Nice but a lot smaller than they show in the pictures. Feel the price is too much for these but comfortable.,Canada,2020-10-08
3,Meh..,Fits small. Would be better with an extra inch of material for chin. Does not fit mens faces well.,Canada,2020-07-21
5,Good value for your money,Perfect mask for necessary times. Please note that you have to purchase additional filters.,Canada,2020-07-01
5,Good value - shrinks on washing,Comfortable mask. Was easy to breathe while wearing as well. However it shrunk quite a bit after I washed it.,Canada,2020-11-08
2,Too small,Not satisfied. Adult version is a kids fit. The flimsy inside lining is so loose it gets sucked in when you breathe.,Canada,2020-12-06

1,WAY TOO SMALL!,"5.25"" length, take a tape measure and see for yourself. Maybe it will fit if you never open your mouth, else its not for North Americans, perhaps other countries where peoples faces are half the size.",Canada,2020-06-02
4,just a plain mask,wanted a simple plain mask for my husband. I like a printed mask something to make myself and others smile in these tough times. A little pricey for 1 mask,Canada,2021-01-24
4,Good fit,"I was cautious about buying this mask because there are so many poor quality ones about. I also noted several people saying it was a small fit. I am an elderly adult male with a standard full face and the mask is comfortable and fits well over the nose and chin. The nose area has a strong bendable strip. At first I found the straps felt short but, as the description says, the straps are adjustable. At first it doesn't seem as though they are but they do move with a little careful pressure. I had separately bought PM 2.5 filters and they fit in the pocket neatly. Surprised one reviewer said they were included but it explicitly says they are not.",US,2020-08-03
1,Very poor product,"I purchased four different colours of these masks.
The first time I applied this navy mask the elastic broke. This could have been really difficult but thankfully I had other masks in my bag.
The mask is also very small and therefore not that comfortable.
I would have expected better for the price I paid .
Very poor.
I also entered into communication with the company who just referred me to amazon for a refund and did not take ownership for the poor workmanship and mask that was not fit for purpose.
Very disappointed with this product and one that is not fit for use and could let you down",US,2020-08-04
5,A good mask,Now that face masks are compulsory in many places this is about the fourth or fifth mask I have bought from various places and it is by far the best. The mask is extremely comfortable to wear and the nose clip helps it sit on your face perfectly. I wear glasses and have found they constantly fog up when wearing a mask but this is much improved with this mask. I will certainly be buying more from this company and have already recommended them to some of my friends.,US,2020-09-14
1,Too difficult to breathe with,"I‚Äôve been wearing disposable face masks and this was my first reusable mask purchase. I find it too difficult to breathe with compared to the disposable ones. I have a fairly normal sized adult male face and find it too small, pushing the tip on my nose down and the straps pulling my eyes forward. Not worth ¬£9.99",US,2020-09-08
4,Comfortable,"I bought this mask for my husband as I liked the first one so much. It is a little small for him as he has large features and a beard! Nevertheless it is soft and comfortable, with adjustable straps to ensure a good fit. There is a pocket inside if you want to add a liner for extra protection. It washes well and dries quickly. (Hand wash in cold water). It arrived promptly.",US,2020-08-05
3,rather small,"the product arrived on time. It was sold for an adult size. My husband had to remove the plastic items on the elastic to make the fit not too tight but even like this, it is a rather tight fit.",US,2020-08-02
2,Disappointing and inadequate for safety.,"The masks are too small. (I haven't got a large face or head.) The elastic on one mask repeatedly slipped away from my ear today. Will not purchase again. Feel so unconfident with these masks, I have ordered some others from a different company.",US,2020-07-28
2,Not satisfactory,This mash causes my glasses to mist up so that it Is difficult to see items clearly when shopping - very disappointing.,US,2020-07-26

3,Alltagsmaske mit ein paar kleinen T√ºcken ...,"F√ºr Menschen mit etwas gr√∂√üeren Kopf k√∂nnte die Maske etwas knapp werden. Bei mir passt sie gerade so, das die Nase noch einigerma√üen abgedeckt ist.

Lieber Verk√§ufer:

Bitte die auf der Verpackung angegebene Farbenummer mit dem Verpackungsinhalt abgleichen. (Marine-Blau war etikettiert und die Maske hatte die Farbe 'rosa').

So etwas kann passieren, sollte es aber nicht. Es ist einfach nur √§rgerlich und mit Umtausch-tamtam verbunden.",Germany,2020-10-15
4,Buon prodotto,"Mascherine ben fatte, comodo il laccetto regolabile. Ne ho acquistate 6 per tutta la famiglia ma la mascherina color Navy, che era per mio marito, √® arrivata di color rosa. Dopo aver fatto il reso e ne ho ordinata un'altra dello stesso colore ma la mascherina √® pi√π piccola di tutte le altre e per lui non va bene. Ora dovr√≤ prendermela io perch√© le ho gi√† lavate, anche se √® un colore che proprio non amo!",Italy,2020-10-20
4,Buona mascherina per il prezzo pagato!,"Non male come mascherina, regolabile, con possibilit√† di inserzione filtro, non propriamente antiappannante per chi usa gli occhiali, ma rispetto alle tradizionali mascherine chirurgiche, si possono tenere a lungo sul viso senza troppi fastidi",Italy,2020-11-05
4,"Buona manifattura, forse un po' piccola nelle dimensioni","Ne ho ordinate due (sono confezionate singolarmente) e sono arrivate molto rapidamente. I filtri no, ed arriveranno tra diversi giorni stando alle previsioni. Aprendo la confezione si nota subito che sono di buona manifattura e sembrano anche robuste. Una prima pecca √® che mi sarei aspettato che almeno nella prima ci fosse stato un filtro, per poterla usare subito... invece no, NON ci sono filtri, e devo aspettare che arrivino. Altra pecca √® che nella descrizione si parla di ""mascherine per adulti"" e non mi pare ci siano altre misure disponibili. Il risultato √® che provandola a mio parere per il mio viso √® troppo piccola ed avendo anche la barba lunga, diventa inutilizzabile. Usando le misure conosciute, se a me andasse bene una XL, direi che quella √® a malapena una L. Credo andr√† bene a mio figlio di 15 anni. Rivedr√≤ la recensione se necessario e se magari il venditore abbia qualcosa da dire.",Italy,2020-10-22
2,Non soddisfatto,"La mascherina non √® di buona fattura e non aderisce bene in viso, oltre a risultare piccola, tanto che quando si muove un po' la bocca per parlare scende subito sotto il naso. Ho dovuto restituirla",Italy,2020-10-12
1,Colore sbagliato !!,"Sono certo che noi uomini non abbiamo la stessa capacit√† di distinguere i colori come le donne ma sono abbastanza sicuro che questa mascherina non sia blu militare come d'altronde √® indicato sull'etichetta,acquistare solo se daltonici !",Italy,2020-10-08
1,Taille enfant au lieu d'adulte.,"Pas conforme du tout, taille unique enfant. Pas du tout adapt√© pour un adulte. C'est dit r√©glable mais m√™me au maximum, vous fait des oreilles d'√©l√©phant. Inconfortable et tr√®s cher pour la qualit√© des mat√©riaux choisis.",France,2020-07-27

5,Ottima qualit√†,"Devo dire davvero comoda anche per un faccione come il mio, grazie agli elastici regolabili. Comoda la tasca per il cambio dei filtri",Italy,2020-11-13
1,C'√® decisamente di meglio,"Mascherina in cotone con porta filtri (senza filtri). Arrivata nei tempi stabiliti ma √® di colore rosa. Avevo scelto il colore blu navy per mio padre, quindi inutilizzabile. Per una mascherina senza filtri e e di colore sbagliato il prezzo √® decisamente elevato",Italy,2020-10-11
2,Viel zu klein ...,"Die Maske ist viel zu klein geschnitten, eher was f√ºr Kinder, der zu weiche Nasenb√ºgel wird deshalb wieder gerade gezogen und verfehlt somit seinen Wirkung. Luft bekommt man aufgrund des sehr dichten √§u√üeren Stoffes auch eher schlecht! F√ºr 9,90 ‚Ç¨ ist die Maske so wesentlich zu teuer, das ist sie definitiv nicht wert.",Germany,2020-10-17

1,Please believe the 1 Star reviews,"Please believe the 1 Star reviews! I ignored them, even I thought there were way too many of them. The 5 star reviews seemed extremely vague and suspect.
Mask is way too small. Claims to be adult sized but I can‚Äôt even get my ears in the loop. Surface area is extremely tiny. I have several masks and this is significantly smaller than all of them.
DO NOT BUY",US,2020-06-29
3,"Fine mask for children and petite ladies, grown men need something else","It seems rather sad that in the midst of a pandemic that has killed over 110,000 Americans, no one seems able to invent a simple sizing system for masks. These masks - like almost everything for sale on Amazon - are for folks of modest facial dimensions. Old men with gourd-like heads and large shnozes need to stick with the paper variety with expandable folds. It's a nice enough mask that I will pass on to a child for their use.",US,2020-06-20
1,Not very big,"I'm not a big man, but this just barely fits from my chin to over my nose. The bridge is cheap plastic, not metal, so it can't really be pinched to fit your nose well. Does not work well if you wear glasses. Complete rip-off for $10.",US,2020-09-22
2,"Fabric clings to face, ear loops tight","I spent a few different shopping sessions trying to find just the right mask and I wanted to love this one. Previously, I used a VOG mask, but it isn't washable. Since mask wearing is a daily need, I needed to make the switch to a washable mask. For this mask, I had to immediately take the rubber adjustments off the ear loops because they were bending my ears forward. Even with the adjustments off, the loops barely go around my ears and the straps started to leave marks on my face. The mask is cut high, and the fabric sits right below the eyes, so you feel it with every eye movement. There is a filter pocket, but the fabric is loose, so it presses against my nose and mouth when the mask is on my face (instead of hovering in front of the mouth if there were more space). I wouldn't want to wear this for a grocery shopping trip, let alone if I had to wear this for work. The nose wire is very weak and doesn't hold its shape. I ordered masks from this company for the whole family (adults and kid sizes), so once those arrive, I'll see how those fit before deciding on returns. If they are like this one, I will be returning them/getting a refund. I'm switching over to Etsy to find a mask.",US,2020-06-25
3,Very small! No nose strip,This came today. This most be for teens. Very small! Does not cover my husband‚Äôs face like the picture. I gave it to my niece. No nose strip for good fitting.,US,2020-06-20
1,Child size not adult size,"This is advertised as an adult mask but it is so small it should be for a child. I‚Äôm an average size mail 5‚Äô9‚Äù, slim built. This was way too small and barely covered my mouth and nose. Strings very short and uncomfortable",US,2020-07-18
5,Perfect fit!,"This mask is a perfect fit for me. Most masks are too big on me but not this one. I love the adjustable ear loops and nose wire, all of which work perfectly. It's soft, comfortable and breathable even in the Florida heat. It has a pocket for a filter if you choose to add one but doing so will make it less breathable. When I held it up to the light, I couldn't see through it and couldn't blow out a match so this mask works for me. I like it so much that I ordered another one in a different color. Love the fast shipping, too!",US,2020-07-22
1,Metal nose piece broke right away,"Not only did this mask press uncomfortably on the tip of my nose (which is NOT large), the metal piece for adjusting the fit over the nose broke the first time I tried adjust it. Terrible fit, NOT worth $10 - I‚Äôll stick with the disposables.",US,2020-08-28
2,Very thin and hard to breath on it,The product shrunk dramatically when washed. It is very thin and really hard to breath on. Very uncomfortable as the fabric keeps getting in my nostrills when breathing. If they actually sew the outer fabric and the inner fabric together I think it will sove this issue and does not really need the opening to insert a filter since the fabric used appears to not let air in and air out.,US,2020-09-05
3,Only for small adults or children,"This mask is of good thickness and seems of good quality. Unfortunately, I had ordered it for my husband and it is way too small although it is marked ""adult"" size and he is a small adult athletic male of 145 lbs.
I will have to use it myself and try to find another larger mask for him since this is a small adult/child size in actuality and I cannot find a larger or men's size on the seller's site.",US,2020-08-16
4,Runs small,This product seems to be sized for a child or small adult. Barely fits an average sized worman. Nicely made with filter (purchased separately) pocket.,US,2020-07-11
5,Simple comfortable mask.,This mask may be a bit small if you have a larger face or your head size makes the ear straps a bit far back. The mask was surprisingly comfortable given that it was a bit tight. It should be good for most women in terms of size and for smaller men or those with narrower faces. There are adjusters on the straps if it is too large. For men with a beard it does not cover much of your chin which could be awkward if you have a full facial hair. Taking all into consideration I feel it was a good purchase.,US,2020-10-10
3,Hit or Miss,"This brand is hit or miss. I've purchased several in different colors and found all are not created equally. Some run smaller than others. I now air dry since two shrunk when I made the mistake of machine drying them before. However, the new batch I purchased still vary in size which is frustrating since I need larger masks to sit higher over my nose to prevent the dreaded glasses fog. If size isn't an issue for you then the thickness, adjustable ear straps, and filter pocket are all great feautures.",US,2020-10-27
1,You can order adult size but it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get it.,"I ordered the adult size for both masks (Navy & Royal Blue colors) on same order. The sizes are very different for both, as you can see from the pictures. The royal blue colored one is the perfect size. The Navy colored one is too small. It is perfect for a child. Navy Blue is my favorite color so I was disappointed that I did not get it in the adult size just like I did for the Royal Blue colored one. I selected adult size for both when I placed my order.",US,2020-11-02
1,Thin Wrinkles,Very small. Cheap material. Wrinkles when washed.,US,2020-07-09
1,Small,"I bought 2 of them the blue one is too small
On the website they should give you the option to buy the correct size
I bought one and it‚Äôs perfect fit
I bought 2 more and I hope that are the correct size s
Because you don‚Äôt know what size will arrive until you receive them
I‚Äôm waiting for the others 2 to arrive and if they are to small I‚Äôll return them",US,2021-02-02
3,"Thin, weird texture","Somehow this mask is both thin and hard to breathe through. I like the ""look"" and its nice to have a filter slot in the mask, but I'm not super impressed with the quality for the cost. The adjustable straps are nice I guess if you have a small head.",US,2020-09-18
5,Great solid color mask (Medium or Large),"Well made washable mask. A bit expensive, but the selection is great. The solid mask fits my husband, too big for me. The embroidered mask that I also purchased fit me perfectly. I guess they assumed a woman was buying a mask with flowers.",US,2020-09-07
3,Less than hoped for,Mask has soft material. Ear loops are NOT adjustable. Ear elastic thus was a bit tight and I have a small head. Filter pocket has only one side opening making filter placement more difficult. I will keep what I ordered but would not buy again.,US,2020-07-31
4,Nice quality face mask,The mask is soft against the skin and cooler to wear than many others. The ear straps were not long enough for me and I am having longer ones added. The mask is smaller than I expected . I think it will work fine once the alterations are made.,US,2020-07-22
4,Overall nice fitting mask.,"Adjustable drawstrings are definitely a plus. Metal nose bridge is unobtrusive and helps fitment. Restriction of air through fabric is definitely noticeable, better than most but still makes my face feel a little hot.",US,2020-10-10
5,"comfortable, good fit","I like the filter option and bought the ones sold to go with this mask. Mask is comfortable, adjustable and wire nose piece is easy to adjust. I have a small face/head and am able to make it fit just fine.",US,2021-01-02
1,Have to throw it away,"I washed the mask in gentle cycle and let it air dry. After about 5 washes , the white inner fabric has two holes. The mask is very comfortable but wish the white fabric was stronger.",US,2020-09-28
2,It is too tight,This is too tight for an adult. I should have read the previous reviews. But is well made but tight. This does not come with a filter either. You buy that separate. That is okay but a tight fit,US,2020-08-16
1,Not Good Value for the money,The cloth mask is thin and does not ship with any filters. I expected more for my 10 dollars. I would not recommend these mask to anyone.,US,2020-09-16
1,Too small,Too small Chinese mask. Threw it away.,US,2020-09-27
2,Annoying,"This mask is very soft, but the inside layer is so loose that every time you breathe you suck it into your mouth and nose.",US,2020-07-10
3,Wrinkles,"These are comfortable and soft. The problem is when you wash them. They wrinkle like crazy!! No one wants to iron a mask. They look like you dug it out from the bottom of a gym bag under a pair of shoes, then slept in them.",US,2021-01-16
1,Ear loops are NOT secure,"Comfort was okay, however, I bought two mask on 7/25 and BOTH were broken by 7/27. This was due to the fact that ear loops legitimately snapped off. It was way too easy. I ignored a lot of the negative reviews, but that was clearly my fault.",US,2020-08-16
5,A little snug - which can be good or bad.,"The mask was a little snug, but tht can be good - doesn't allow virus in, or bad - stugg over nose/mouth. But able to get the filter in fairly easily and adjust strap -- didn't seem to be quite enuf strap, perhaps that why a little snug. But then it might stretch out, only worn once.",US,2021-02-04
2,not recommended,"This wasnt a comfortable fit even before i washed it and AFTERWARDS it literally shrunk...since I don't have a 3 year old to put it on, into the garbage it goes. Waste of money!!",US,2020-08-16
5,Nice mask,Nice mask. I like that it‚Äôs stiff enough to not get inhaled with breathing. Comfortable as well. Cotton canvas outside seems tightly woven for protection.,US,2020-12-29
3,If you are large.... Adult won't work!,"Consider this fitting a large size child. It was very tight on my face I am a 5'9"" male adult, and it was toooooooo tight!",US,2020-09-16
5,Nice re-usable mask.,Exactly as advertised. Comfortable and adjustable which is why I chose. Unfortunate they changed the washing instructions to hand wash only instead of machine washable.,US,2020-09-14
4,Have to figure it out,Filter pocket has opening on only one side. Had to fold filter in half to insert then used chop sticks to adjust,US,2020-10-11
2,Snug,"I‚Äôm not a large person, and this mask runs small. The fit is snug with little room for lip movements and breathing.",US,2020-10-28
3,Not great coverage.,"This mask is a little small. It's cute, but it barely clears my chin. When it comes out of the wash, it's very wrinkly.",US,2021-01-01
5,Really Great,Really nice mask. Comfortable and easy to wash. Love that it has a filter pocket.,US,2020-09-04
4,Mask,Like the material it made out of and the opening for the filter is good. Just a little small for a man but works great for the wife. Quick delivery! Would purchase again if they have a larger one.,US,2020-07-20
1,Small mask,Mask is too small!,US,2020-08-25
3,Small for an adult male face. buy recommended filters with it.,Short for my face. Nose to under chin to short. My wife able to use it.,US,2020-06-21
5,Great price and quality!,I purchased this mask for my grandson who is serving a mission for our church in Arkansas. He loved the color and said it fit well! Definitely a good purchase!,US,2021-01-12
3,Face madk,I don‚Äôt like it because it‚Äôs not big enough it says it‚Äôs for a adult but it‚Äôs an awful little adult I‚Äôm thinking about sending it back,US,2020-08-16
4,Inconsistent sizing,I bought a few of these for my husband and he didn't like how the different colors fit inconsistently. They are well made just not uniform with sizing.,US,2020-12-17
5,Fit my husband,"My husband has a big head, this mask fit.",US,2020-08-21
5,Great mask for smaller faces,I have a small face and this fit me perfectly. The straps are adjustable which is an added bonus. I like that I can put a filter in too as it has a pocket for a filter. It appears well made.,US,2020-08-27
1,Not sized for adults - barely fit my 6YO daughter.,"This product is not made for adults. I purchased it for myself, and it would not even fit my six-year-old daughter. Absolutely ridiculous that this would be sold for adults, and then when it arrives and doesn‚Äôt fit you can‚Äôt get your money back. The seller is a complete scam and should be avoided.",US,2020-12-09
4,Functional Mask,"It is a good mask. Uses the 2.5 filters. At first it felt a little small for my face, but after wearing it a while I was good.",US,2020-08-12

2,Size Matters,These masks are very small. And shrank after the 1st wash! Ended up a waste of money.,US,2020-10-24

5,Comoda y..,Ajusta bien..,US,2020-07-28
1,It is poorly and cheaply made and might be okay for the size of a small child.,"We disliked everything about this mask. The size, material, paper like. It is being sent back. Certainly not worth the price or any price.",US,2020-08-20
5,Better than the cheap masks,Comfortable Adjustable ear loops,US,2020-07-22
2,Too small for average folks,This mask is small. The East loops pull your ears. I am pretty much average size. All other masks fit me fine Material is thin and to close to nose and mouth.,US,2020-09-14

5,Just what I wanted- so much better than others for breatheability,Wore it to a wedding and it was perfect,US,2020-10-03
2,This is a small size,This is almost too small for an adult. Believe it should have been listed as a child's mask. If over the nose on an adult then it barely comes down past the lower lip.,US,2020-06-29
1,"To small, wrong color","Not the color ordered, to small and my face is small.",US,2020-09-27

5,Great quality reusable masks,"These are great reusable masks. Well made with adjustable earloops and a nose clip. There is a pouch to insert a filter but filters are not supplied. Don't really need them.

I now have four of these masks since it looks like we will be living with coronavirus for awhile.

I've had some poor experiences with other masks and I'm really pleased to find a worthwhile brand. At ¬£9.99 each they are a little pricey but with these masks you are paying for quality.",US,2020-09-24
5,"Great face mask, light and comfortable.","This is a light and comfortable face mask with adjustable ear loops which allow a good fit. It has an inside pocket for filters to be inserted and replaced. It is fairly breathable, which is nice as I struggle with other masks. It was delivered promptly. Happy to recommend.",US,2020-09-21
4,"Good, but not quite there","The style is good but the mask doesn‚Äôt fit like those illustrated. It‚Äôs not big enough for truly successful chin coverage. The nose wire is a bit thick and inflexible. It could all be sewn a bit neater. Also, the elastic has been twisted prior to insertion in the adjuster",US,2020-10-31
3,A bit small.,"They seem well made, but to say they are ‚Äòadult‚Äô size is just wrong, even at the maximum size, certainly not really for non Asian males. They might be OK after a lot of stretching. The quality is good over all though.",US,2020-07-17
4,Quit a snug fit,Quit light and breathable for 3 layers. Got these for the adjustable ear loops but the masks are quite snug and the loops could be a bit longer as it‚Äôs just about big enough my husband,US,2020-08-24

5,Good quality mask,Comfortable and easy to wear/wash,US,2021-01-09
2,Ziemlich Luftdicht,"Das Produkt f√ºhlt sich wertig an und sieht auch so aus.
Die Gummi sind recht kurz, so das ich den Kunststoffclip zur Verstellung erst entfernen musst um abstehende Ohren zu vermeiden.
Aber ich kann den Stoff nur als recht Luftdicht bezeichnen, man atmet relativ schwer durch den Stoff und entsprechend wieder aus. Die Maske bl√§ht sich dabei auf und die Luft kann im Prinzip nur nach oben raus trotz Nasenb√ºgel, f√ºr Brillentr√§ger eher unsch√∂n. Das sollte dieses Produkt eigentlich vermeiden lt Beschreibung.
Ich hab inzwischen mehrere unterschiedliche Modelle und Fabrikate, diese ist allerdings nicht unter meinen Favoriten",Germany,2020-12-15
5,Ottima mascherina in tessuto lavabile con custodia per filtro,"La mascherina arrivata risponde appieno alle caratteristiche descritte e l'ho trovata sicuramente ottimale. Una nota stonata: la presenza del ferretto per modellare la zona nasale, onde evitare l'appannamento degli occhiali; questo ferretto purtroppo non impedisce al respiro di appannare l'occhiale, perci√≤ lo considero inutile.
Nel complesso per√≤, dopo diversi lavaggi, devo dire che la mascherina conserva le stesse propriet√† di quando mi √® arrivata. Per questo do le 5 stelle!

Belle couleur, le produit √† l'air de bonne qualit√©. A voir apr√®s le lavage.",France,2020-11-04
4,Haut les masques !,"Cette √©trange p√©riode sanitaire qui s‚Äôallonge nous oblige √† faire la part belle aux masques pour se prot√©ger et prot√©ger les autres. Au-del√† des masques chirurgicaux se sont d√©velopp√©s toute une s√©rie de masques en tissu aux motifs et formes plus ou moins r√©ussis.

Ce masque fait plut√¥t partie des bonnes surprises, et je ne comprends pas bien les commentaires tr√®s n√©gatifs. Certes, il risque d‚Äô√™tre un peu petit pour quelqu‚Äôun poss√©dant un fort p√©rim√®tre cr√¢nien, mais ma compagne le porte sans probl√®me.

Il s‚Äôadapte via des petites boules permettant de fixer les √©lastiques de chaque c√¥t√©, ce qui lui permet de plut√¥t bien coller au visage (et surtout de le positionner comme on veut !). Il est possible de lui adjoindre un filtre suppl√©mentaire, et il est vrai qu‚Äôon aurait pu appr√©cier en avoir un dedans, au moins pour essayer.

Pour autant, il est pr√©vu pour √™tre utilis√© sans, et dans le contexte actuel, le masque tel quel, sans le filtre donc, suffit tr√®s bien.

Le port est plut√¥t agr√©able, le tissu int√©rieur assez doux, bref, c‚Äôest plut√¥t tr√®s bien.

Le seul vrai souci survient quand on lit les informations pour le lavage : seulement √† la main alors que dans le m√™me temps, les autorit√©s sanitaires pr√©conisent un lavage des masques √† 60 degr√©s... Du coup, il passe √† la machine √† laver √† 40 degr√©s chez moi. Au bout de quelques lavages, il tient le coup, on verra dans quelques semaines.

Quelques h√©sitations sur les finitions montrent une conception un peu faiblarde qui aurait pu √™tre mieux pens√©e, et qui aurait donn√© les cinq √©toiles sans probl√®me. Dommage, m√™me si cela reste tout √† fait honorable.",France,2020-09-11
5,"Tr√®s bon masques, bien con√ßu et tissu agr√©able","Ayant lu beaucoup de commentaires n√©gatifs au sujet de ce masque, il me tardait de le recevoir. C'est chose faite, et en toute sinc√©rit√©, j'en suis tr√®s satisfait. La coupe est bonne, le tissu est de bonne qualit√© et est CO for table, de m√™me pour les √©lastiques lat√©raux.

Le color bleu marine est conforme √† mes attentes. Ce masque est de pr√©f√©rence √† associer aux filtres √† charbon de la m√™me marque, vendus s√©par√©ment. Une petite poche est pr√©vue au verso du masque.

La taille correspond √† celle d'un adulte, contrairement √† ce que j'ai pu lire. Je fais 1m80 pour 86kg, ce masque me va parfaitement.",France,2020-08-23
3,"A coupler avec les filtres √† charbon, et taille trop petit","J'ai retirer les bagues de serrage des √©lastiques mais malgr√© tout le tissu et les √©lastiques restent un peu trop petits pour un adulte.
De plus, sans filtre √† charbon, le masque manque un peu d'√©paisseur et de protection.
L'ensemble reste n√©anmoins de qualit√© et est confortable.",France,2020-08-27
5,Un bon masque,"Mon fils aime beaucoup ce masque qu'il trouve tr√®s agr√©able √† porter.
Le masque s'adapte bien sur la figure.
On peut adapter les √©lastiques qui passent derri√®re les oreilles.
Les coutures sont bien faites.
C'est un bon masque.",France,2020-09-13
1,Nice material bad quality control,Nice material but got 2 same color navy one bigger then the other and when tried them off they both broke in the same place elastic came off from mask. Keeping them will sew them but very disappointed in quality. I brought them because made in USA....quality control awful.....update: ordered different colors purple and royal blue really nice quality no problems returned the navy ones.,US,2020-09-19
5,I love my Weddingstar Masks!,"I love my Weddingstar masks. They are comfortable, have a filter pocket, excellent quality material and the flexible nose piece stands up even in the wash. I buy these for my whole family because they are not only protective, but also fashionable. You can tell the real masks from the fake. Weddingstar always has their name printed on the inside of the fabric on all their masks!",US,2020-12-14
5,"Light, comfortable and breathable.","I love thees masks! They are soft, comfortable and breathable. I am ordering more. I wish like the seller would make them for children as they are light and breathable. Highly recommend‚Äô. Thank you.",US,2020-06-11
5,Great value. Works great and passes the match test.,"Great value for the money. Alot of different products have 3 layers, so I like the fact that this has am extra layer of protection. Also, this passes the match test, which is when you try to blow out a match with the mask on. I also love the fact that there's the built in nose metal, so that you can contour it for a tighter seal. Overall, great buy considering its 50 peices and its 4 layers. Will buy another pack to keep in the car.",Canada,2020-10-13
2,3 strikes you're out,"Bought these because they boasted that with all of the rush for masks nowadays they stand above the rest by not sacrificing their high quality standards. But if thats the case they were never good quality.
Strike 1: Pleats fold up. That alone is not an issue. Just slightly annoying.
Strike 2: Smelly. Not the worst but its definitely there.
Strike 3: Their high quality metal nose strip is a freaking garbage bag tie! And not even a good one. (Photo attached). It is so useless that I am suprised its even advertised as having one. And that was my big selling point to help reduce glasses fog.
Would not recomend for those with glasses.",Canada,2020-11-19
5,Pretty big for my small face,"I work at the school board and we must protect ourselves. I had a couple of cotton masks from my lashing job but needed more. I saw my coworker wearing these and bought some fir myself as I felt the price was really good. Upon receiving them, I absolutely loved how high quality it was and it was definetly thicker than any disposable mask. Unfortunately, it was too big for my face.....I'm still giving it 5 stars as the quality and the price at the time of purchase ($20?) was very good.",Canada,2020-11-24
1,Don't buy,"Received them and tried one on, strap broke within 2 minutes, tried another, same thing, then a third, etc. These are going into the garbage. Don't waste your money on these, workmanship is terrible. I hardly ever write a bad review, but this product deserves it.",Canada,2020-12-18
1,Not 4 ply,These are not 4 ply they are 3. They are very thin.,Canada,2020-11-09
1,NOT KIDS SIZED! Very disappointed,"I ordered these for my 7-year old son to wear to school as we just found out all students are now required to wear masks. These are NOT kids sized. My son is the typical size of a 7 year old kid and there is no way that these are kid sized. It was baggy and hanging down to his chin. I tried it on and it fitted me like an ‚Äòadult mask‚Äô.

The quality of the mask looks good - and I like that it‚Äôs black - but frustrated because I bought 2 packs and they don‚Äôt fit my son as advertised being for kids his age.

Not even close to his size! If you‚Äôre looking for KiDS sizing - this is NOT the product for you.",Canada,2020-11-17
4,"Cheap, good quality feel, a bit large and the nose strip is very thin","I've purchased quite a few different masks over the past 8 months. This product overall has a good quality feel. The only down sides are the earloops which are a bit loose for my liking and the nose strip which is very flimsy.

The earloops are not overly large, simply they are not as tight as I am used to. Some people will have to cross the loop in front of their ears (I never have to do this) and some with a smaller face will just find them too large to fit (ie. my wife).

As for the nose strip, it works, and you can adjust and readjust, but because it is very thin it doesn't quite hold the shape you give it. I have to press down on it frequently. For most people it's not a problem, but if like me you wear glasses and live where freezing temperatures are common, the best way to prevent fogging of your glasses is to have the mask as high up as you can and as close to the nose as possible. This way your breath goes down instead of up. And so these tend to fog up my glasses more than the others did with a more rigid or thicker nose strip. This is my main issue with them and why I didn't give a 5-star rating.

But for the most part, it serves its purpose. 4/5",Canada,2020-11-30
5,exactly as expected,"arrived quick and are exactly as expected. A little thicker than the blue ones i had ordered elsewhere previously, but the fit is good and i am happy",Canada,2020-11-02
5,Great Masks,"I‚Äôve never had issues with acne in my life...and then came covid and daily mask wearing. I used to use reusable cloth masks every day, but I found I was breaking out from them. I got these disposable ones and they‚Äôre great. My skin is flawless again and it‚Äôs easier to breathe in these when I go out. Will be buying again!",Canada,2020-11-17
5,Bought for my parents,"I bought this for my parents who are visiting the hospital weekly for medical appointments. When they arrive, the hospital gives them a different one to use, versus their own, so it is better to use a disposable mask instead of a reusable one going to the hospital. We bought a different colour/style for ourselves, and my husband said the material is very soft and stretchy, more comfortable on the face than other kinds of masks we've tried.",Canada,2021-01-23
5,great quality and value,"order arrived quickly and face masks are of good quality. they fit my larger fact perfectly, and are not too tight. the material is also heavier, maybe that's due to the 4 ply / layers of protection, but i couldn't have asked for a better mask. nice color too. you can never have to many masks",Canada,2020-10-16
3,Disappointing...,"A number of the masks only had one ear loop string...so they‚Äôre useless.Also,the pleats are facing the wrong way but for me it doesn‚Äôt matter because they get stretched out.For what they are,they‚Äôre just okay.Definitely should‚Äôve been cheaper & better made (no quality control).Won‚Äôt buy these again.",Canada,2020-11-24
4,gets the job done,"As a retail worker who is trying to take precautions in the pandemic, I like being able to throw away a used mask at the end of the day to reduce the risk of spreading germs to my family at home. Finding black disposable masks has been a challenge, and since I don't particularly like the look of the classic blue ones - not that looks really matter when you're trying to keep safe - these were a great find! They do fit quite large, (I am am average sized woman with what I think is an average sized face) so I find that I have to twist the straps once or twice to get them to stay in place better, and the nose bridge isn't the greatest and definitely doesn't reduce glasses fog as much as I would like, but they get the job done and pass the lighter/match breath test. These masks are more than large enough to cover my nose and extend down well past my chin, but the straps are quite thin and tend to dig into the backs of my ears after awhile. However, I can usually make it through a typical day/shift without much discomfort. All in all, these work as described and not having to worry about washing and reusing is always a bonus.",Canada,2021-01-20
1,Not environmentally friendly,"This product is produced in China. I made the wrong assumption it was made in Canada. As well, each mask came individually wrapped and sealed in a plastic sleeve, which is truly very bad for the environment/our land fills (not recyclable plastic) and our Canada Chief Health Officer advises to store masks in paper bags/paper products to prevent mold and these are surrounded by plastic. I do not recommend this product for these specific reasons.",Canada,2021-02-01
5,More comfortable than washables,"They look pretty good for a disposable. Fit well enough without too much tugging on the ears. Would prefer washables/reusables to be a little more eco-friendly, but this is the better option when it comes to health protection, in both directions. Also don't have to worry if the kids forget them anyway (as they often do). Will buy again.",Canada,2020-11-21
1,Product NOT as described and protection is non-existent - very little.,"This product may have had a manufacturing defect in processing, but if someone didn't catch this, and wore the masks thinking it was offering them the maximum protection would be at great risk during a Pandemic. The box that I received was 1/2 full of masks that were made fine, but the other 1/2 of the box just had the top layer of the mask with the elastics for the ears and the rest of the filter fabric was non existent. Sadly, I really liked the ones that were made correctly, but not at all impressed with the overall purchase and concerned that others may have gotten the defected masks and didn't catch the compromised ones and wore them!. VERY saddened by this purchase and when I thought that I still had lots of masks, I find out that I don't!. So much for trying to find the best masks and staying stocked up.",Canada,2021-01-11
5,Bien,Tr√®s bien √©tant donn√©e que j'ai pas le droit au masque lavable maintenant au travail. Merci beaucoup,Canada,2020-10-19
1,Buyers beware,"I can take a photo of brand new ones coming out of the box but these mask seem to be reused because of the quality and deterioration.

Trust me when I say please find another place to order your mask and my box also came open.

I‚Äôm a essential worker and frontline response and mask for work are very essential and I felt let down by this purchase",Canada,2021-01-17
2,Very fragile with a smell!,I bought it because I wanted black masks and they look good but I was very disappointed with the smell when you wear them a new pair for the first time. There‚Äôs an unpleasant smell to every single one of them that lasts until you go nose blind to it or the smell dissipates and the elastics are very badly glued so they break very easily.,Canada,2021-01-11
2,Something in these makes my face rash,I ordered these and had to leave them out of the plastic to ‚Äúair out‚Äù as the smell was strong...chemically. Now when I use them I get a rash. I am super sensitive to chemicals so others may not have a problem but I wouldn‚Äôt order another box. The fit is okay and I like the fact they are black but I can‚Äôt wear very long without nasty side effects,Canada,2021-01-14
5,Quality 4 layer masks that are comfortable to wear all day,"Likes:
- easy to wear all day
- thick yet breathable
- 4 layers offers more protection, passes the lighter test
- good quality and look great

Dislikes:
- Amazon shipped them in a polybag so the box was bent a bit but the masks themselves were not affected. Not a reason I wouldn‚Äôt repurchase though.",Canada,2020-11-21
1,The strap breaks when you put it on,"I bought tons of different types of disposable masks, these are the only ones that failed. The strap breaks when you put it on, so it's garbage material before you even have a chance to use it. Very poor quality, do not recommend at all you waste your money on these. Great design though! But what's the point?!",Canada,2021-01-29
3,Didn't work for us,"These were, as advertised, very soft, and thicker than standard. The workmanship seems solid. However, the ear loops are way too big for my ten year old, and there were big gaps at the sides. I would tie them or otherwise alter them, but the masks have a slight chemical smell and he won't wear them. Some kids may not be bothered. These are advertised as being individually wrapped ""for sharing with family and friends""; mine came in 5 plastic wrapped bundles of 10. That wouldn't be an issue for us but I mention it in case this is a selling feature for others. I will donate these somewhere as I'm sure someone can get use of of them but they were not a great purchase for my family.",Canada,2021-02-01
5,High quality face masks for small faces,"Perfect size for petite faces! Ear loops are made of a soft material that doesn't cut up your ears like most blue disposable medical masks. Ear loops stretch very well without tugging on the ears and they also don't come apart like some poorly manufactured masks. Mask materials are thick, yet soft and comfortable when worn on the skin and bridge of nose for extended periods of time. Black colour makes it versatile to be worn with most outfits including business casual and work uniforms.",Canada,2021-01-16
5,Great kids mask!,"Perfect fit for my 7 yr old! Looks as advertised. Came fast and in excellent condition. In box has 5 individual wrapped (10 packs) of mask. No smell and great quality. Will buy again and will definitely recommend! Need more good mask for kids, so hard to find so thanks you. Please make more! üò∑üôÇ",Canada,2020-12-23
5,Great product!,I am extremely finicky when it comes to placing anything over my face. These masks are comfortable and do not irritate me at all. I wear them for 8 hours at least per day in the customer service industry where I have to talk to people consistently and my voice isn't muffled. They are thicker than the regular blue one and the material is comfortable. Bought 2 boxes of them. Only issue I had in one box was the ear loops on a few of them were not attached but overall great product.,Canada,2021-01-31
3,"Fabulous look and feel, not durable enough.","Bought a box of these masks. Feels very smooth and comfortable. Honestly they don't make me feel itchy when I wear them unlike the other masks.

However, out of the 50 that I bought, 10 broke before i could get out of my apartment (the band breaks). Which isn't a great value if you pay for 50 and break 10.",Canada,2021-01-12
1,FALSE ADVERTISING! BUYER BEWARE!!,"So... when I buy masks advertising 4 layers of protection, I expect 4 LAYERS... NOT 3 layers and ear loops!! Never mind the blatant lie written in BOLD on the box, look at the ""4 features"" shown in the product photo. Sure enough, vendor is selling 3 layer masks, not 4 layer!",Canada,2020-11-27
3,Pleats are folded in the wrong direction,Pleats are folded the wrong way so it looks like you‚Äôre not wearing the mask correctly - otherwise these are great. I‚Äôm buying wire nose strips so I can wear them with the folds the right way. Despite the good quality I would only buy these again if it was confirmed that the folds were corrected and then they‚Äôd be my first choice.,Canada,2020-11-16
3,Smell of 2nd hand smoke was embedded into the masks,"Item was delivery in a vehicle that someone had smoked cigarettes in. The packaging had such a strong smell that it transferred to my hands. I opened the package to remove the box of masks to let them air out. After sitting for 10 hours in a smoke free garage, the masks smell very strongly of 2nd hand smoke. I can not have my child wear them and do not want them stinking up my house any longer. They are now in a garbage bag outside..... Very disappointed.

Masks seemed to be a good quality, just the lack of care delivering it has ruined the experience.",Canada,2020-11-24
2,Difficult to breathe,"I appreciate that the masks are made with (probably) high-quality, thick material, but it is extremely difficult to breathe in it. When I inhale, the entire mask gets pulled into my face and is suffocating. Not comfortable at all.",Canada,2021-01-28
5,Perfect Size For Kids,"Sometimes you don't know what you're going to get but the masks are a prefect size for kids. They are good quality, comfortable and a nice addition to the reusable masks we have. The color is great, I bought black for both my kids.",Canada,2021-01-16
3,Air escapes out the bridge of the nose,"The nose strip is too thin and doesn't form a good seal at the bridge if your nose. It tends to fog up my glasses a lot more, which tells me that a lot of air is escaping out the top which is not good",Canada,2021-02-02
5,Best masks,I love these masks. They‚Äôre just like the blue medical ones but in black. Bought them purely for looks but black goes with more of my clothes so they‚Äôre great for me. They‚Äôre white on the inside which is fine for me but I was expecting all black.,Canada,2021-01-05
5,Parfait,"Pour la premi√®re depuis le covid, j'ai enfin trouv√© un masque confortable et bien ajust√©!
J'ai du acheter 20 sortes de masques. Fier vous a mon review ils sont parfait! Seul hic je trouve qu'il sont sur emball√©!",Canada,2021-02-01
1,NOT child sized,"Ear loops way too large for a child. I have a smaller head and can often get away with wearing smaller masks, but the ear loops are even too huge on me, while the physical material portion too small. Decent quality but completely useless to anyone in the household due to the super un proportionate sizing.",Canada,2021-01-09
5,Best disposable mask,This is the softest disposable face mask I have purchased so far. It‚Äôs also thicker than other brands. It definitely feels and looks higher quality. I would definitely recommend this product. You get what you pay for.,Canada,2021-01-31
5,Pleat issue resolved love these masks!,"These arrived today. I love them! I think the issue about others mentioned (pleats upside down) has been resolved. I still got a $5.00 coupon. I will purchase them again! Super soft, the mask is a little larger than others I‚Äôve used, which is nice, very comfortable!",Canada,2020-11-28
5,Comfortable and passes the blow test,"No more expensive than the light blue masks and not as ""medical"" looking. Nice long bridge strip to fit for wearing with glasses, soft inner layer that doesn't chafe at lips if talking.",Canada,2020-12-12
2,face masks,These were kind of disappointing. Too big for the face and the wire does is not strong enough to pinch the mask around your nose. I had to tie it around my ears twice to stay on my face.,Canada,2021-01-20
3,"good quality, earloops are big. Not for children unless they have bigger than average faces.",Masks are decent-good quality. They aren't medical grade and don't pretend to be. They're as advertised except I found the earloops rather large making them a little too big for small children. Better for small adult/ large child face. Trustworthy compared to most masks on amazon at least but don't recommend for small children. Decent,Canada,2020-12-24
1,Straps break after 1 hour,"You can‚Äôt even get a full days wear from these masks. Each one consistently breaks (the elastics snap) within 3 hours of wear, sometimes sooner. Because of this I‚Äôve been left stranded without a mask and unable to go into stores, multiple times.. don‚Äôt waste your money.",Canada,2021-02-05
5,Great masks,I was afraid that the masks would be super stiff as they have 4 layers however quite the contrary. Comfortable to wear and no issues with breathing. I would definitely buy again,Canada,2021-01-30
4,Fit my 12 year old son perfectly!,"True to size, no tugging at the ears and great coverage! My son's first reaction though was ""oh it smells funny"" but after wearing the mask at school, he never mentioned a ""smell"" again. He's worn it to school for a few days and no complains since we received the box.",Canada,2021-01-13
2,The color is great. Some of the packs had the pleats the wrong way.,I liked the color. The thickness was good as well. They had a bit of a smell to them unfortunately. One thing I didn‚Äôt like is that three of the packs seemed defective....the pleats of the mask were the wrong way which made wearing the ones that had the pleats wrong quite uncomfortable.,Canada,2020-12-05
5,Perfect !,Literally the most comfortable masks I‚Äôve had so far!Myself and my family love these! They‚Äôre so comfortable we couldn‚Äôt believe how much nicer they are than our washable masks! And they look so much fancier to ! 10\10 I will only be buying these from now on !,Canada,2021-01-15
3,They are ok,Overall good but in a 50pieces box I had about 15 that the elastics broke off within 1h use,Canada,2020-10-28
5,"Thick, breathable, good.","These are really good masks. I was surprised that I could breathe so well because each mask is very thick. It wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable on the ears or hot on the face at all, and I had to wear for 8+ hours (with glasses btw). I will definitely buy this again when I run out of this box.",Canada,2020-11-09
5,Niveaux de protection contre la COVID-19,Le masque est celui que docteur ¬´ Tam ¬ª a sugg√©r√© pour la pand√©mie avec la couche de polystyr√®ne. On se sent bien prot√©g√© et comme ils sont jetable clear encore mieux. Mes enfants les porte aussi pour l‚Äô√©cole et ne se plaignent pas d‚Äô√™tre inconfortable! Un 5 √©toiles bien m√©rit√©!,Canada,2021-01-31
5,Very thick!,"These masks are awesome, thicker than any other disposable masks I've seen around. Perfect for the kids, I dropped some of these into the sanitary Halloween gifts i packaged for the little ones.",Canada,2020-11-05
5,They seem like decent quality for the price,"These fit pretty well, they are easy to breathe in and they don't look as bad as the traditional blue ones. So far, I'm happy with this order.",Canada,2020-11-16
5,Excellent,Don't let the comment about tying to size the straps. They should fit almost anyone without having to mess with the strings. Comfortable and light.,Canada,2020-11-10
2,Decent quality,One of the reasons I wanted to buy this product was to easily breathe through my mask and not let my glasses fog up but it did not work for me .,Canada,2021-01-14
5,Good value,"These came quite quickly are as described. Packaged in 10 per pack, seem to fit well and no weird smell. I would def order these again.",Canada,2020-11-19
3,Big,"I would say overly big (and I don't have a small head). It often gets up to my eyes. It doesn't keep its shape around the nose.

I don't really care much about the thickness as I'm not overly scared of covid, I just need to have something for the public transport.",Canada,2020-11-20
5,Finally found a mask I like,After more than a dozen mask purchases I found one that fits and is comfortable. Our employer carries the standard Blue disposable masks. Now everyone is asking for these.,Canada,2021-01-30
1,Garbage!!,"These masks were a total waste of money! For every 1 that was good 3 or 4 broke before I got a chance to wear them. They also smells horrible. Had it not been for the pandemic I would have returned them!
Save your money and get another brand!!",Canada,2021-01-13
5,I would buy again,"The masks are great. They fit well, look good and doesn‚Äôt fog my glasses.

My favourite part is how they‚Äôre all individually packaged.

The only knock that I have is the box was essentially destroyed during delivery. No big deal",Canada,2021-01-26
5,Cute!,These are nicely packaged and look just like the picture. They fit my face really well and are comfortable/stylish!,Canada,2020-12-21
2,not well made,I bought these masks and everytime i try to put them on the elastic has broke .very displeased with product,Canada,2021-02-02
5,"Comfortable, protective, great buy!",Love this mask. I gave some to each member of my family and they all said how comfortable it is. Will buy again.,Canada,2021-01-03
1,Time consuming to unwrap each individual mask üëé,"Why are they individually wrapped in plastic? That‚Äôs so wasteful, they could of been wrapped in sections at least. It also makes grabbing a mask way more inconvenient and time consuming. Boo!
The actual mask are fine, but not worth the hassle of wrestling with plastic every time you need one.",Canada,2021-01-27
5,Perfect,"Out of all the masks that we have had made & ordered these ones win for everything.
Will be buying more as we need them.",Canada,2021-01-05
5,"They're good masks, like the blue ones, a little thicker.","I like them, they're good, thick, and breathable. Like the blue ones. My order came quite fast. Very satisfied! 5 stars",Canada,2020-12-12
5,Would(but Hopefully Won't Have to) Buy Again,The masks were reasonably priced compared to other like products. They arrived ahead of schedule. I was happy with them.,Canada,2020-11-09
5,Great quality,"Masks are great, as someone who wears glasses a wire is a must. Great quality.",Canada,2020-11-30
5,Well made and at a very good price,"These are the most comfortable masks I have purchased. They fit well, have little or no odour and seem to be very well made.",Canada,2020-11-25
2,A few defective masks but good quality,I love the style and look of these masks. They have relatively good durability. My only complaint is a couple of my masks in the package were looped together (factory error) so they broke apart when separating them. So about 8 out of 50 masks were defective.,Canada,2020-11-06
5,Great!,"Love that they come in convenient 10 packs. Easy to throw a pack in each car, in bags, wherever.",Canada,2020-11-17
5,Great buy.,I love them. They‚Äôre individually wrapped. The elastic is better. It hasn‚Äôt broken on any I‚Äôve worn unlike the other ones.,Canada,2021-01-23

1,"Upside down pleats, false advertising.",I spent hours reading reviews and wanted a safe mask made in North America. This ad said ‚Äúproudly made in North American‚Äù. Well I buy a trial box and it says ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù with all the toxic and badly made things coming out of there I didn‚Äôt want to put something on my body thats made there. The pleats are upside down.,Canada,2020-10-22
2,Comfortable but manufacturing defect in all pieces,"Quality and Feel: Material is really soft and as stated has 4 layers (image attached) but unfortunately the product has a defect and because of which probably they are selling it with a discount coupon.

Defect: The way it should fold is downwards as every other mask (see the fold on the blue mask in the image attached), but the product they shipped is the opposite way. Unfortunately even their product images in the description on Amazon, they have 2 different pics, one with fold upwards and the other with downwards.

If you are fine wearing it this way, as I am, go for it. Else wait for their defective lot to be over and then order new (which I have no idea when will happen, or they might have every lot defective). 2 Stars for good material, -3 for the defect.",Canada,2020-11-04
1,Defective - pleats are upside down,The pleats are upside down on the masks. It is very hard to breathe in it. Very disappointed. I wish they had mentioned that it was defective but should have known something was wrong with it since they had a $5 coupon. Don't waste your money.,Canada,2020-10-20
1,Error on Manufacturing!,"Looks quite nice, BUT, the folding was done mistakenly. Foldings should be downright below nose bridge not upward. Instead of avoiding to catch airborne particles, it does the opposite.",Canada,2020-11-02
5,I love these masks!,I love theses masks! They are much higher quality than the usual disposable masks especially with the extra layer of protection. The are super cute and convenient.,Canada,2020-12-03
5,Best disposable masks!,These masks are incredible!,Canada,2020-12-21
2,Pleats upside down.,"So, I ordered these masks for my grandkids. There was a coupon, and I thought they were a great value. I read the reviews, and lots of good reviews. The package was awesome. They were in individual plastic, within the box. So, the first time my grandson wore one, I picked him up from school and he said they had a weird smell. Then, I looked at the pleats, and sure enough, they are upside down! So, obviously, these masks are not good for covid! I would not purchase these again.",Canada,2020-11-08
5,Price quality is excellent,"So I had been shopping for better looking kids masks as they lose them way too regularly for washable ones...

Found this pack and decided to try it out and the quality versus price ratio is excellent also sizing is good for my kids from 5 to 11 years old.

Definitely recommend to everyone looking at this pack.",Canada,2020-11-20
4,Decent but creases are Upside down.,"I was hoping for fitting masks as the blue ones, but these open more on the sides unfortunately.
Still decent for the price, and black is nice.
If the pleats where facing down then this order would have gotten a better rating from me,
Will still use but not for shopping trips or where there are too many people.
I don‚Äôt feel these masks are as safe as the 3 layer material ones.
These are just good for a quick jump to the store then trash it.",Canada,2020-12-06
5,Comfortable,I have a fairly large face with a beard and these masks are the best I've found for staying in place. Also being made of polypropoline they are not a woven product so are very good at trapping particulates. They also pass the match test and once put on and the pleats pulled open stays much better than the cotton ones that seem to want to fold back flat.,Canada,2020-11-13
4,thicker and covers face well,it is thicker than the blue masks I have been used. but the material is a bit smelly and not soft (a bit like those reusable bags). overall it shapes fine and covers well.,Canada,2020-10-18
5,Works great.,"For anyone concerned with the pleats/folds being upside down, the mask should be stretched on your face to cover nose and mouth - pleat direction doesn't matter.

I have worn these for over a month. Very comfortable. Nice and soft, big enough for my face, ear loops are soft. I have already ordered more!",Canada,2020-10-25
1,"Do not buy, in my opinion, unless you are an acrobat and plan to walk on your hands around town.","These seem to me to be rejects...the pleats are the wrong way on the black ones I purchased.
In my opinion, they look funny and give a poor fit and probably provide less protection with the pleats being upside down; as well the loops are too stretchy causing a loose and irregular fit. I assume, especially when combined with the wrong way pleats, that these may fail to protect others well enough with these issues, even though they are 4 ply.",Canada,2020-11-25
5,Individually wrapped,"I do like that these say 4 ply.. though they seem as thick as the usual 3 ply ones I wear. I did rip one open and there is very thin layers on them. I do like that they are individually wrapped so are easy to toss into my backpack when on the go. Nicely made. I was not disappointed,",Canada,2021-02-05
5,Fit comfortably for Adult face,"Found these to be well constructed and fit comfortably with ample room between mouth and mask...so you can actually breath and speak without feeling restricted. They look good and for a disposable, nothing negative here.
50 count package at a reasonable price. GOOD BUY.",Canada,2020-11-11
5,I've ditched my reusable masks for these.,"Although these are a bit costly, they're breathable, which is paramount for me. I find that every cotton reusable mask I've purchased makes me sweat. These don't. Plus, black goes with everything. ;)

I've purchased these 3 times, so I'd recommend them for sure.",Canada,2021-01-21
5,I will buy again ! Great for 8+ kids and small adults.,"Great for teens or adults with small faces.

5,Amazing!,"I‚Äôm an adult with a small face, and these kids masks fit perfectly, they don‚Äôt pull up into my eyes and have gaps around the sides, even my husband loves them and would wear them if his beard didn‚Äôt stick out around it!",Canada,2020-12-28
5,High quality sturdy mask,This is a great sturdy mask for my child. I emphasize the sturdiness of this product because it holds up to other disposable masks I have purchased which often break when putting on/off a mask - this is a quality product! Item arrived quickly too! Highly recommend,Canada,2020-10-31
5,Premium slick and high quality masks!,"Super premium quality and the fact that they were individually packaged was very impressive. Super sleek, comfortable, doesn‚Äôt feel heavy on the face like thick fabric, and very functional. A big step above the regular disposable face masks and looks even nicer than fabric reusable masks. Highly recommended!! Thank you so much!!",Canada,2021-01-22
5,Great quality,"I don't usually use disposable masks but I like to keep them in the car just incase.

1,Mask not made correctly,"I had to send my order back. The masks were made incorrectly, with the mask pleats pointing up. I'm guessing that they were put in the assembly line upside down. I'm going to look for a brand with better QA processes -- this is a mistake that should have been discovered before the product arrived to me. Makes me wonder what other issues have not been caught...",US,2020-10-10
5,Definite Must-Buy!,"Let me start by saying that these arrived extremely quickly! My kids were down to their last two masks when I purchased them, so I‚Äôm so grateful that we didn‚Äôt have to wait for them to arrive. My kids are extremely picky about what masks they will wear, but they will keep these ones on without any nagging, which is a true testament to how soft and comfortable they are. These masks are specially designed for kids in a kid-friendly size, and also includes the metal nose strip so you can adjust them to fit perfectly, as well as upgraded earloops, which are so much more comfortable than other kids disposable face masks that we have tried. After seeing me wear black masks, my kids insist on only wearing black masks, so these are a great find. These are the only 4-layer black disposable kids face masks we have been able to find; we have purchased other 3-layer ones, and you can really tell the difference. They are so much thicker than the average mask, but my kids have reported back that they are more breathable than average masks. We have recommended them to all of our friends who have kids, and will definitely be buying more ourselves!",US,2020-09-16
1,Disappointed,"This seems to me like a regular 3ply mask. The box states ‚Äú made with four layers but only list 3 . Outer layer , Middle Layer and Inner Layer. I purchase it thinking it would be 4 layers and more protection. Paying the extra money for this was a waste. Plus the ear loop popped as soon as I went to put it on . Disappointed üëé",US,2020-10-20
5,Impressive & Easy to Use,"These face masks are perfect for adults, like me who have a smaller face. I found the extra length on the ear is perfect and the coverage of my face and nose is exactly what I need. Because of the size of the mask, my face is not ""lost"" as it would be if it was a ""normal adult"" size. The thickness does not interfer with my breathing and I feel very comfortable wearing it out in public. I would also highly recommend for children and adults.",US,2020-10-08
5,Get the job done! Good quality,Bought them for a weekend trip. Needed some disposable mask since I wouldn‚Äôt have access to a washer where I could wash my cloth mask. They were sturdy and thick. They come in batches. I‚Äôm fine with this this because single packages mask is tooo much plastic. They got the job done given the price.,US,2020-10-31
5,Kids (and parents) approved!,These are definitely higher quality masks than the usual disposable masks. I like the convenience of these masks and also the extra layer of protection. I've been looking for masks that fit my kids (12 and 10). My kids like the comfortable fit (longer ear loops and bendable nose cover) and soft materials. And these mask don‚Äôt smell synthetic! Plus with the black color the kids don‚Äôt look like the medical staff. So hopefully now they are comfortable wearing masks for longer periods than before.,US,2020-09-28
5,Very Happy Customer,"I normally don't write reviews but I had to for these masks.. They are very comfortable, breathable, and exactly as described.. My son has asthma so I am so afraid he will not be safe if he gets the virus but with these masks I am a little more comforted that he is more protected.. I have bought so many kinds and brands but these definitely surpass all the rest... They fit well and are not cheaply made.. Not saying they are really big but they even fit my face.. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely buy more when we run out.",US,2020-10-05
5,Thick and breathable!,Very nice ... I bought these mask because many reviews said they were thick and protective and the reviews were absolutely correct! Every time I grab one I think I grabbed two but I only have one in my hand...this is a plus!!! They are very nicely made ! No weird smell and very breathable despite the thickness. I'm very comfortable wearing these mask. I will definitely be stocking up on these . A good disposal mask is hard to find.,US,2020-10-18
1,DONT BUY THESE. ALL A LIE.,"1.Notice the box says four layers but the box says only three. 2. Notice the disclaimer that these do not protect you from anything. 3. The packaging is a mess. This is cheaply made. I love my kiddos too much I want to protect them, not endanger them.",US,2020-10-16
5,Great disposable mask.,Great disposable mask with an adjustable nose piece. Fits well and disposable. I like that they are black since my makeup doesn't show on these as easily as it does on white ones. Matches my outfits better than white as well. Highly recommend.,US,2020-10-11
4,Be aware these have LARGE ear loops.,I like the black. I cut open and confirmed they ARE 4 ply. They are nice and soft to ware. The only problem I have is the ear loops are too big. And twisting them to tighten them before putting them on makes the bask bulge at the sides which of course is NOT safe when wearing this mask. This mask will have to be worn UNDER another mask for the added protection but can't be worn alone. Just be aware.,US,2020-10-05
5,Great choice for kids!,"These fit my 10-year-old grandson perfectly! The added bonus was that they came in 5 individually wrapped packets of 10 masks inside the box, making it so much easier to put in different vehicles while keeping them clean!",US,2020-11-30
1,Not 4 layers as claimed,"This item lies. It says it is 4 layers. It's not. It is 3 layers but they count the ear straps as a layer, making four. They actually look and feel two layer. The box description of the layers is a different then the posted description on Amazon. Don't fall for it. They're actually too big for my seven year olds face. Wouldn't recommend at all.",US,2020-11-19
5,High quality masks!,"I have to admit, I was skeptical when I first purchased these, as I‚Äôve purchased many different brands of disposable masks over the last few months. The box states that they are 4 layer masks, and they aren‚Äôt lying. I actually cut them open to check! They are noticeably thicker than the average surgical masks, yet somehow they feel more breathable than average masks. They are very soft and comfortable; not scratchy or rough at all like some of the disposable masks that are available on the market. The ear loops are much more comfortable than any other mask I have worn, and don‚Äôt dig into your ears. The ear loops are also longer than some other surgical masks so they don‚Äôt tug on my ears making it really suitable for all adults.",US,2020-09-29
3,Pleats -- up or down?,"Well made. Robust. 4 layers. Comfy. Fit well. Black is cooler than blue. Gaps at the sides, like all these disposable surgical-type masks--that's the biggest limitation.
Pleats? They face up, like a pocket. CNN and NY Times says they should face down. Some reviewers here do too. I see no guidance from CDC (in a quick look). I don't know. I will note that in most of the close-up photos of the product, the pleats face up; on a model's face, down. So no guidance there. Is it random, are they all like this, or is it inconsistent manufacturing? Should I care? Intuitively, yes, pleats down makes sense, especially as a dust mask (i.e., the pockets catch dust and it sits there). For filtering out viral aerosols, it seems less important. You can spread then mask out, like a fan, and the pleats disappear. You've still got 4 layers of polypropylene between you and the virus. I would feel slightly better if the pleats faced down, but that may just be the influence what the experts say. Might buy again.",US,2020-11-23
2,Ear straps keep breaking making them useless. But man they are soft.,"They are so soft! Great for my 7,8, and 10 year old. However, 2 stars because they each wore one tonight and 2 out of the 3 ear loops broke.
Mind you my kids are in masks daily with school and haven't had any other brand break on us. Sad because I was going to buy more because of how soft they were.",US,2020-12-23
1,Does not protect your child read read read,"These mask have the pleats pointing down which is wrong... the seller says the FDA has no restrictions for non medical non sterile mask... which these are... they do not protect your child from germs of any kind.. I do not recommend these...Look for some the FDA approves of.

Viva‚Äôs disposable non-medical masks have not been FDA cleared or approved but are authorized under an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) for use as source control by the general public. This authorization is only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist.

5,Fits and looks great! Winner with kid and mom,"My 10 year old son loved these. I feel like these surgical type disposable masks are much more effective than any of the cotton or regular clothing material types you can buy in clothing stores. Those may look cool, but don't do as good as a job protecting. Instead of just having him use the ""boring"" blue surgical type masks, I was looking for something that looked more cool...kind of like the cloth ones. This fit the bill perfectly! He loves the camo blue design and says it's comfortable to wear. It has the metal in the upper part to fit around the nose. The loops seem sturdy and comfortable. Win win for kid and mom!",US,2021-01-06
5,Great quality for my taste.,"I was reading 1 star reviews. One I can agree with it that they are big. These are not for children or those who have a smaller than average Bridge-to-Chin ratio. It should fit around the middle of the bridge of your nose and comfortably under the chin. I am happy with the size.

I saw a majority of the 1 stars complaining about the pleads. I could probably do a Google search but logically, it's done more for compact storage and should not affect the integrity of the mask. I mean, the pleads shouldn't be that visible if you're extending the mask over your face properly; Mid-bridge and under chin. These obviously not N95 styled masks. You should have a good enough seal to breath in without letting in air and breath out while letting air out the sides of the mask. Glasses wearers should not be worrying about foggy lenses when worn properly.

The material is much better than my previously purchased masks by SOOQOO (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M9MJPVW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
I struggled to get a proper fit and the material was very thin despite having 3 layers. Got itchy from moving it around my face so much while adjusting. Yup a big ""NO NO"" right now. I loved the brand FWPP, but masks in black are currently unavailable. These are the next best thing, IMO.",US,2020-11-20
5,Comfortable for my child,"The masks are comfortable for my child. We appreciate the metal nose strip to reduce fogging of glasses. I also like how the 50 pack is divided into smaller packs within the box. We intend to keep a pack in each car, so we are never without a spare mask.",US,2020-09-24
1,ITCHY AND HUGE,"These are the itchiest masks in history. They are EXTREMELY itchy. There are little hairs that scratch your mouth and nose if you wear it for longer than a half hour the mask starts to break down and the little itchy hairs come out.
I bought them for myself as I am an adult with a somewhat small face, and they are still way to big. They aren‚Äôt even close to fitting properly on my kids, they‚Äôre huge!!",US,2020-10-25
5,Actual quality masks.,"These are much thicker than my previous blue masks which is a plus and what I was looking for.

I was looking at other black masks and lots of reviewers complained how thin they were. These definitely aren't thin!

The straps are higher quality as well and have yet to have one break - I'd probably have to use a lot of force to achieve that. They are a little bit more snug that I expected, so I'll probably wear my mask extender with them, no big deal.

I like how each mask is packaged individually in plastic so I can safely store some in my purse and other bags.

Also these have no odor nor are they scratchy, the inner material is pretty soft. My last masks would make my nose itch quite often but I don't think I'll have that issue with these.

Finally, I have minimal fog with my glasses with these (the only mask I've ever been 100% fog free from is an actual respirator).",US,2021-01-22
5,Still good buy! Quality!,"3rd time purchasing OMG still very good, 4 layers as old ones and now they have these new cutie patterns, so cute!",US,2020-10-03
4,Thicker black disposable mask,"I really like that these black disposable masks are thicker than the regular blue ones. They fit just like the blue ones but it seems that the masks covers more of your chin which is great. Because these are thicker, the nose wire doesn‚Äôt poke your face like some of the blue ones. I would definitely repurchase. The masks are wrapped in plastic per 10 pieces. I got these for $13.95 a box because there was a coupon. Regularly each box of 50 is $18.95.",US,2020-10-06
1,Too big!,These masks are too big for preschool and kindergarten-age kids! My 3 and 6-year olds have very large heads (in the 98-99th percentile) and these masks slide off them even the kids aren't talking. I tried using a lanyard which seems to help the 6-year old on the tighest setting but not the preschooler. Such a disappointment!,US,2020-10-09
4,TOO LOOSE (for an adult!),"I‚Äôm an adult and the ear loops on this are ridiculously large. So large it makes the whole mask very loose, and that‚Äôs for me‚Äî as an adult. I can‚Äôt imagine this properly fitting a child, especially a young one. I buy kids masks because adult masks are always too big & the sides/top are open & it doesn‚Äôt really protect when it‚Äôs like that; kids masks are always a perfect, snug fit. I have to say the quality of the mask fabric itself is excellent, but it‚Äôs slightly larger than most kid masks‚Äî I can work with that. But the ear loops are extremely long/loose and so therefore the mask still has gaps on the side, making it not protective at all. I‚Äôm giving this 3 stars, but if they shorten the ear loops (and replace my box) I would give it 5 stars! I hope the manufacturer takes this into consideration.

****UPDATE: I‚Äôve been able to tie off the ear loops so they‚Äôre tighter, now the fit is perfect! It would be nice to not have to do that, but at least there‚Äôs a solution üëç updating to 4 stars",US,2020-10-20
3,They re good and bad at the same time,"OK these are supposed to be 4 ply material. They feel tight but it is due more to the design/size of it than the materials. I also mind you the box clearly state they are ""Non medical disposable mask"". However and somehow these are slightly smaller dimension than most other masks I ever got for the past year. If there's such a thing as Adult small/medium, these must be it but it does not say that on the package.

Consequently, with my Asian face with smaller nose/jaw around facial construction, these masks fit a lot better than any other masks I ever got. HOWEVER, they smell little bit.... funny. As though it either is using funny smelling materials, or it has been stored in the funny smelling place. I CAN NOT PIN POINT WHAT KIND OF SMELL THIS IS, IT JUST IS NOT VERY SUPER PLEASANT. Maybe I get used to it if I stay with them for a whole but in the mean time, I don't really know if it is very healthy to wear masks that smells funny.

But, this is a big but. I never found a mask that fits better on my face than this one. As a result it gives me fairly secure feeling that I'm getting tighter fit and better filtering. Yet the smell....... I usually wear a clothes mask under these surgical type mask, maybe I getaway with it if I keep doing that.

Do I recommend them to anyone? I do to anyone who can tolerate the smell and be confident s/he will not be sick from it, who's facial construction is smaller than average American faces. Otherwise, please purchase them at your own risk.",US,2021-02-05
5,Best mask so far after multiple purchases from multiple sellers,"My 7 and 10 year olds (average size) love this one the best. We went through so many, and they said this is the softest and also they fit around their ears most comfortably without having have to twist the strap to make them shorter.",US,2021-01-09
1,"Good fit and feel, but pleats are facing up and not down...","The size of these are a little bigger than little kids sizes, but smaller than adult. I have a smaller face and full sized adult masks are not comfortable for me. These fit and feel great however are defective as the pleats don't point downward. Pleats on masks should face downward and the biggest pleat of the mask should be on top. Not sure if this is how all masks are made or if it was just the batch I had. The return process has been initiated.",US,2020-12-31
5,As advertised,"Confirmed 4 layers. Put a few tbsp of water in it and nothing leaked through at all after a minute. Wore it outside in 30degree weather and condensation beaded up inside which was gross but I guess good because it means it was contained? Slight smell to the mask but not terrible and didn't give me a headache. Nose piece worked well and stayed in place. Failed candle test but have heard mixed info on how much that matters.
Only actual complaint is that there was a sharp thing sticking out where the ear band was attached on the one I wore but I was able to flatten it out enough with my finger. Didn't see it on the one I cut open so hopefully an anomaly.",US,2021-01-23
4,"Comfy and true 4-layer, but not downward pleats","It fits quite large for myself, female adult, but it fits good on my boyfriend. Soft touch, ear loops are comfy. And the one I tested was a true 4 layers, good. The only downside is, pleats should open downward according to the guidelines for the medical professionals. But I didn't find any articles about not using the upward pleats for the regular public, non-medical professionals, I would be able to use these for going to grocery/holiday shopping which is a bit risky and stressful with the another rona-wave. Packaged with 5 separate bags inside the box, which is another plus if you consider sharing them with your family/friends. I would recommend this if the upward pleats don't bother you.",US,2020-11-24
5,They are a good product.,"I like them because they are not a heavy material. Sometimes I have a problem breathing, and I feel like I am suffocating. The stings that fit around the ears is very comfortable. I'll be purchasing some more.",US,2020-09-28
5,100% Great buy for kids!,"These are great! Fit my kids faces (ages 8-13) well. Comfortable for them all. Only minor adjusting for my 8 year old on the ears. They provide and extra layer of protection which we appreciate. I cut them open to see and they are all there (the layers) you can feel the quality in them vs in store purchases we‚Äôve had. At many stores in town and out of town.

We used these specifically for travel from state to state while we moved. But I like them so much that I will continue purchasing them for my children to use as needed. They also prefer them over the others they‚Äôve used. Definitely recommend these!

*they last, don‚Äôt tear, don‚Äôt smell, comfort, fit well, no breaking ear pieces. Great quality.

**UPDATE. Just got my second order and these came individually wrapped which is even better!! Love that! My kids can grab and go without having to touch others. Yea!!! Added photos to show!",US,2021-01-27
5,Perfect fit,My kid chews on cloth mask so I had to buy these for schools. Fits him perfect !,US,2020-09-17
5,High quality well fitting.,I bought these mask because they were black and not hospital blue like most disposable masks. These are the best quality disposable masks I have ever used. The mask forms nicely around the nose and fits snug against the face with no gaps. I have a beard and some masks are too small and don't fit well but these do. I do think these will fit any adult face without problem. The materials used are high quality as well plus 4 layers instead of 3 layers like most disposables for added protection. I will be buying another box because I like a fresh mask at least once daily. These masks are so comfortable I may continue to wear a mask during flu season when in public after COVID-19 is over. Please wear your masks and get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine becomes available to you.,US,2020-12-22
5,Four layers of fabrics for better protection,"Just received this cute masks, love the packaging. The product is in great quality and no smells at all. Viva Naturals always has great products, coconut oil is my favorite and now it's the mask. ü§ó",US,2020-09-21
5,Great value! Masks are exactly as advertised.,"They are exactly as they say. That being said, we found that my son does not need the extra length with the ear loops. We just tied each side up a little to make them work for him but if your kiddo does need the extra length these would probably work great. There is a slight smell to them but it wasn‚Äôt bothersome to me or my son. The part I liked best is that they are 4 layers. I cut one of the masks into two pieces to verify this and was very pleased to see that there were in fact 4 layers.",US,2020-10-15
5,Comfortable,Bought for my grandson to wear to school. He is 7 and loves them. He says they are much more comfortable than a cloth mask.,US,2021-01-07
5,Comfortable Quality Kids Masks,The Vivanaturals disposable face masks for kids are of the best quality. They feel like soft cloth and are multi-layered and very comfortable. I bought them for my grandson who just turned 2. The fit is excellent. I have a small head so they fit me too! The packaging threw me. I thought they were blue masks but they are Black. The mask quality exceeded my expectations. I would definitely buy again.,US,2020-09-22
4,4.5 stars - nice quality!,"I got these so my kids could have back ups ready in our vehicles. They're great quality - nice and thick, well-constructed! The ear loops are a little too long for my 4 year old (easily fixed), but fit my 10 year old perfectly. The width of the mask (ear-to-ear wise) is a little shorter than ideal for the 10year old, but the mask does still have good enough coverage. I'm happy with the purchase overall and my 10 year old said the mask was comfortable to wear.",US,2020-10-20
5,Good for my toddler,Bought these for my 2.5 year old. The ear loops were a little too long for him but I made him ear savers that makes it a perfect fit and they‚Äôll be able to fit him as he grows. Disposable masks are cleaner and we just dispose after each use. I don‚Äôt have to worry about washing his masks and having them in his bag anymore. The efficacy of these surgical masks are also better than cloth ones from the research I‚Äôve seen.,US,2020-12-29
5,Most Comfortable Disposable Masks!!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I love these!! For disposable masks, these are the most comfortable of the different ones I‚Äôve tried. I love the thick triple layer material, and it feels so soft. The straps are very soft and comfy too. I really appreciate the adjustable piece over the nose. It makes it fit better so I can see more and keeps my sunglasses from fogging up! Great price for the quality, for how cute they are, and for the amount per box!",US,2020-11-10
3,Cute and soft,Since I work at the hospital I have to wear these mask all day long. I love how soft these ones are. But there‚Äôs a smell about him that I can‚Äôt get used to. I hate that allows my breath and air to go up into my eyes and made me tear up. And I don‚Äôt feel that I can reuse them as often as I want to. That being said I still think they‚Äôre very pretty and I love the softness about them.,US,2021-01-10
5,Cutest face mask!!!,"Just because you have to wear a mask, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have a fashionable designer face mask‚Ä¶ and let me tell you, this is the most fashionable face mask I have been able to find! I have gotten so many compliments while wearing them; people are constantly asking me where I bought them. Over the past few months, I have been on the hunt for a cute face mask, and in particular, a cute pink face mask. The shade of pink on this mask is amazing - not too bright or gaudy, as most other pink disposable face masks seem to be. The crown design is unique and attractive; I am as comfortable wearing this out shopping as I am to work. I can dress it up or down. Most people who have seen me wear this mask think that it‚Äôs a high quality cloth mask, and not a disposable mask. Many of my friends have also purchased them after seeing mine. I will absolutely be buying more of them for myself!

Comfort - 10/10

These masks are super comfortable and a perfect fit for adult faces. The ear loops are a lot more comfortable than regular masks, as they are made with spandex to allow for a comfortable stretch. The outer material feels almost velvet like and is very soft on your face. I could easily wear these for hours at a time.

Fit - 5/5

I have absolutely no complaints, because these masks fit perfectly! Unlike lots of other masks that I‚Äôve tried, they completely cover the nose and mouth. They are also incredibly easy to put on and take off, so you don‚Äôt waste a lot of time putting the mask on or taking it off throughout the course of your day.

Most surgical masks that I‚Äôve bought tug on my ears, but these are slightly longer and don‚Äôt pull on my ears, however they definitely fit securely without any gaps so you can feel confident about being protected. This makes such a big difference - my ears didn‚Äôt hurt at all, even after wearing this mask for many hours.

Breathability - 5/5

These masks are noticeably thicker than regular masks, yet you do not feel like you are suffocating. I‚Äôve tried many masks over the last few months, and these ones are top notch on the breathability scale.

Quality - 5/5

You can tell that this is a good quality product. The mask is made of three layers, so they feel thicker than a lot of other masks you can buy out there. Masks with three layers are the most effective at reducing airborne droplet dispersal, so I make sure to always buy three-layer masks. The middle layer is a melt-blown layer, which helps to prevent airborne particles and bacteria from entering your airway.

Whenever I buy a new mask, I always perform a couple of tests on them. There are so many poor quality masks out there, so this is really important, as I want to make sure that I‚Äôm using something that really protects me. First, I test the mask with water, by holding the mask with the outside layer facing up, then pouring some water onto it. On this particular mask, the water did not permeate, and the inside layers did not get wet, which proves it‚Äôs effectiveness at repelling airborne droplet/particles. The second test I always perform is the flame test, in which you cut the mask open, and put a flame to the middle layer (i.e. the melt-blown layer). When performing the flame test on this mask, the middle layer did not catch fire and burn, which also proves that this melt-blown layer does, in fact, exist in this mask. There are lots of poor quality masks out there, and these are two tests which can give you peace of mind.

Overall Thoughts -
It‚Äôs a super comfortable, fashionable mask for coronavirus protection that looks great and fits well. It is suitable for wearing for hours on end. 5 Stars!",US,2020-11-01
3,So cute but have had many ear loops break.,"I really love the size, design and quality of the masks themselves but my 5 & 7 year old have had many ear loops break. We've had the box for a week and they have had 5 break on them. They are using 1-2 masks per day each.",US,2021-01-11
4,4 Layer is the way to go!!,"I feel much safer with the 4 ply mask. I normally wear a KN95 with one of these over top to keep the KN95 mask protected. I like to use these alone when I'm walking outside and not around many people. I live with my 90-year-old grandfather so I go through insane caution!
The only thing that might be affecting the breath/airflow is the direction of the pleats. These angle upward as opposed to most masks facing downward. I feel like it might be directing my breath upward, fogging up my glasses. But that's just a theory...
Overall I totally recommend these as these are great quality and 4 ply",US,2021-01-06
5,Great junior face mask,"These fit boys age 11, 12 perfect. They thought they were ""cool""",US,2020-12-30
5,Nice black disposable masks,"Nice change from the normal blue/white masks. Have been able to wear a couple times before disposing. Good quality, as well.",US,2020-10-15
1,Too bad the elastic breaks,"Out of a box of 50 masks, less than 10 did not have the elastic break. Some broke putting on with the first wearing, while wearing, or putting back on. Not one mask lasted longer than a few hours of wear. All of this is too bad because they were a nice feeling and comfortable mask. Slightly larger for a man's face. So disappointed given the good reviews.",US,2021-01-30
5,Very pleased with this mask,"I feel this mask serves it's purpose very well. No mask is absolutely comfortable but this mask is more comfortable than most. I've worn it for long periods of time and never felt any type of notable discomfort or irritation. It's very well constructed and has no odor. It's made like the blue medical mask but it seems to have an extra layer of protection. Cosmetically, the black color matches it with everything you wear. I would highly recommend this mask.",US,2020-12-09
4,It's only 3 ply,I was disappointed to learn that it was not a 4 ply mask as described. Other reviewers had mentioned that also. Some reviewers complained that the mask pleats faced upwards. I found that to be the case only if the mask wasn't under my chin. Some reviewers complained that the ear cords came loose from the mask. So far the ear cords work fine. I wear the mask only for brief visits to grocery stores and other locations. The masks work just fine for those visits. To get 50 masks for such a low price was a bargain despite it being 3 ply .,US,2020-12-22
5,Great for Adults with Small Faces!,I‚Äôm an adult but I have a small face and head so I bought these and they fit perfectly. They don‚Äôt slip around and poke the bottom of your eyes since they‚Äôre so small and fit snugly. They also look much nicer than the big masks because they look dainty and fitting instead of giant and bulky.,US,2020-10-30
3,Pleats face the wrong way! Otherwise these are great,These are comfortable for my child who needs to wear masks everyday to his school. These don't hurt his ears and they fit him well (he's 9). The only thing is that with the nose grip on it you have to wear the pleats so they open upward- that's 100% the wrong way the pleating should be. Maybe it's just this batch that got produced incorrectly? The germs would rest in the pleats this way. I try to puff the pleats all the way out so that they don't do this but I probably won't re-purchase these again.,US,2021-01-14
5,LOVE these face masks!,"This has been one of the best purchases ever. I was hesitant thinking these were over priced three ply masks, but they are sooo much more. First of all, they are soft. I have to buy a lot of PPP for my job, and I bought these thinking they were something different and fun, but these have been everyone's favorite. The pink isn't too bright, it's more of a muted color so the men always choose them over the blue bland ones. Then the crowns are the ultimate finishing touch!
LOVE LOVE LOVE these masks!",US,2021-01-16
1,Nose clip is worthless,"These masks are very cute, thick, breathable. The material looks and feels like fabric, but they have a major flaw. The nose clip is so thin and weak that the mask does not adapt to your nose. This a major problem if you are using glasses. If you don't have glasses, probably they work.",US,2020-12-29
2,Not a great fit.,These masks looked like they were going to be great but are not a good fit for my 8 and 10 year olds. The masks aren't wide enough and the sides bunch up meaning that my kids breath is not contained by the mask. The long loops actually make the fit too loose so not only do the masks bunch open at the sides but they aren't really tight enough around the rest of the face. I can't see them working on younger kids with smaller faces for that reason.,US,2021-01-10
1,Defective and useless,One of the strings on every mask is not properly fastened and breaks free within the first hour of use rendering them useless.,US,2021-01-30
5,Love these!,"Best so far. I literally hate anything being on my face.. glasses, my hair and most certainly masks. Every mask I‚Äôve worn I‚Äôve wanted to tear off within minutes. Wearing other masked (disposable and cloth) I‚Äôve found it hard to breath, they‚Äôve been itchy and have swallowed my face. I ordered the kids size and they are perfect!!! I can breathe but I‚Äôm protected and the size is perfect! I‚Äôm gonna order more black but I‚Äôm waiting for the grey to be back in stock.",US,2020-12-13
5,Kid approved mask,"This is my second purchase because my boys asked that I order them again. They just grab and go on their way to school. So convenient and they have not complained once. Stays on, never slides down and it's comfortable for them. No issues with breakouts and doesn't make them sweat throughout the day eventhough they change out their mask 2-3 mask a day while in school.
Priced well so no issues with ordering more as needed
Shipping was super fast.",US,2020-12-12
5,Four Ply?!,"Nothing to dislike. Just having a 4-ply is (I assume) an upgrade from the boxes of 3-ply disposables that I had been buying. I always worry that I'm gonna get a kid's sized box as that did happen to me once. But these fit my adult face even a little better than most of the other ""adult"" masks I've ordered. I do think these felt a bit thicker, they fit, and I thought the price was reasonable given what these boxed masks go for. I'm happy with them.",US,2020-12-10
2,Good but only for a couple of hours of use.,"I like that fact that they are very comfortable and lightweight. Some ripped at the ear strings but the worst thing about this mask are the fact that you can only wear them for a couple of hours and not an entire work shift since the fabric inside the mask starts to pull apart when it rubs with your lips and your often breathing the fabric particles that make up the inside of the mask. At work I started feeling discomfort because of this and later couldn‚Äôt stop sneezing because the little strings of fabric were going into my nose and mouth luckily for me my job has other masks at hand.
Buy another brand if you will be using this for work or are gonna be wearing them for a prolonged time.",US,2021-01-17
4,Soft and Breathable,"These masks are very soft and breathable which makes them very comfortable. They didn't irritate my skin like a lot of other masks do. The ear loops are securely fastened to the mask and are a good length. The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the color as it looked much more muted in person than the picture online. Overall, they were a good purchase and I would recommend these masks. I would purchase them again if I needed more masks.",US,2020-11-30
5,Affordable quality masks,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Yes. The price is reasonable. The product‚Äôs material is of high quality. There's also a metal ring for the nose but if you use it for a long time, the mask goes up to the eye. Not the nose side but on the other side they can put on something like a rubber band and it will not go up promptly. The product is easy to use. The instructions helped me too much with that. I obsessed with this product and recommend it to my friends and family, or anyone who needs especially these days. Thanks for reading my comment and have a safe and sound day.",US,2020-12-17
5,Best disposable masks around (and SO cute)!,"My nickname is ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äù and my favorite color is pink, so I HAD to give these a try. I have a million washable masks, most are tough to breathe in or make my face sweat. These masks were SO much better than expected! The material is thicker than regular disposable masks. The nose piece bends and stays perfectly in place all day. They are very breathable-I also use them for working out. Completely worth it for the money!! I just ordered another box!",US,2021-01-22
5,Good quality,"These are well made, with nice, sturdy material. My son's school requires masks all day long and I didn't want to have to worry about washing reusables all the time. He wears these all day long and I haven't heard any complaints yet, which, for a 6 year old, is an impressive feat.",US,2021-01-12
3,Not for small-faced adults.,"If you‚Äôre an adult and have a small face, as I do, don‚Äôt assume these will fit. I encountered someone at work wearing one of these, which looked like it fit way better than my adult one, so I ordered a box. When I tried one, every time I opened my mouth to speak, the mask pulled down off my nose. I gave the co-worker the remainder. Too bad, especially because the denser-than-usual material seemed like it would be very effective.",US,2021-01-07
1,Very poor quality,Very poor quality. Straps come unglued very easily. You will end up regretting this purchase. These are the cheapest disposable masks on Amazon for a reason. In the middle of a pandemic where masks are required to enter most places imagine your mask strap breaking leaving you without the mask you need to shop. You shouldn't have to walk around with spares in your pocket just to know you can stay protected.,US,2020-12-28
5,Great product.,"These work great. I am an ER nurse and due to the shortage in PPE, my place of employment has provided us with itchy single ply masks that kill your ears. I purchased these on my own and they work perfect, the don‚Äôt kill your ears, they are extra protection, and an added plus...they look cool!",US,2021-01-20
4,Get the job done,"Received product quickly. I like to keep extra masks in the glove compartment of my car in case I forget to grab a washable one before I leave home and go to a business where it‚Äôs required. These are great for this purpose because they are packaged in small plastic sections that are easy to throw into my car. The fit is a little loose for me and might be better for men vs women. I appreciate that they are black because they look less medical, and also that the nose piece is adjustable.",US,2020-10-12
5,Excellent choice for larger faces/heads,"Compared to most of the masks now in convenience and big box stores, these are larger and therefore easier to fit to larger faces/heads. The ear loops are comfy even for my size 7 3/4 head. You can definitely sense a thicker, heftier feel on the face, but there is no difference in breathability with more standard 3-ply masks. The black looks a little sleeker and a bit less medical on the face. I'm buying more.",US,2020-10-12
5,Fits small adult face,"I like that the pattern isn't kid-oriented and love that it fits my small adult face. The ear elastics would be more comfortable if they were wider. This is the first disposable that I've been able to wear, so I'm happy.",US,2021-01-20
5,Much better than other disposable masks,"Finally, I found masks that are large enough and that do not easily break. I ordered a box of another vendor‚Äôs masks. If you look at them, they break. Not these masks. The straps are generously sized and well attached. I have not had one yet to break. They are also four ply, so I feel I have extra protection against Covid. They are also large enough to hold the lipstick saver molds that I got to provide extra breathing space.",US,2020-10-27
5,Breathable and Protective!!!!,"I bought these masks for a back up to my cloth face mask. I carried a few with me when I went out and even was able to give some to people who were in need

These masks are very thick and protective. To make things even better they are comfortable. The only issue I have is that the nose area was a little big but not something that would make me purchase them again or recommend them to my family and friends.

These masks are soft, comfortable and breathable. I plan on buying more",US,2021-01-05
2,Broke my sons face out on a rash,"The masks for perfectly and would have been perfect however, my son skin on his face turned into a rash. We kept him out of school for a week because of it a d during that week it cleared up. We tried them for one more week to make sure it was the mask and he broke out again in a rash. Now that he is out for Christmas break and he is not wearing them, his face cleared up again.",US,2020-12-29
4,Fit my son's face well,"These masks fit my son's face fairly well. He is 12 years old. Not sure if he was younger, if the masks would fit his face as well. They seem comfortable and good quality. Though the box says 4 layers, yet we have found that the mask really is only 3, with the ear loops counting as the 4th layer, which seems a little humorous to say. It's fine though, they seem to fit well and look nicer than the white or blue masks, since they are black.",US,2020-10-29
1,BEWARE DO NOT BUY,"Loved the look of the masks, but EVERYONE broke. The elastic bands are glued and do not hold for much longer than a couple of hours. The only way you can wear thru a shift is to staple the elastic to the mask. I've bought thousands of masks from other vendors for my staff since this craziness started and had no problem. Bought these because we liked the navy color. BEWARE....do not buy.",US,2020-12-18
4,4 layers. Pleats wrong. Fit inside clothmask.,"Def thicker, and is 4 layers.
Would 5 stars if only pleats were down instead of up.
Keeping as we use in filter pocket of cloth masks, fits easier than regular size in smaller masks. Less expensive than the small pm1s.

Or to do a quick purchase, instead of cloth.

Great price. Perfect fit for our smaller faces. Ear loops fit well.",US,2020-12-19
4,More for a large child or an adult,"For a ""kids"" mask it was really too big. my 7 year old grand-daughter had gaping all the way around the mask. Even my 11 year old grandson had an issue with gaping on the sides. My husband tried one on and while it was not as wide as the regular adult mask, he could use it. No gaping for him. Overall the quality of the mask is great. However, it's really not of a size to fit most children.",US,2020-10-25
3,mix feeling about it.,"I have a mix feeling about this. It is comfortable and the nice looking, my kids seems to wear it without taking it out. However the ear-loop is kind of stretchy and have to tie a knot in order for it to fit nicely. Also there‚Äôs a gap on the side the mask between cheeks and mask which might not be as effective covering . My kids are ages 2& 6, i think this is suitable for more older kids",US,2020-10-15
5,Good quality for price.,I cut a mask open and there‚Äôs four layers. I like how they package in small clusters so you can easily put in your purse or console of your car. I have purchased many different masks since the pandemic and these are my favorite.,US,2020-10-19
5,Super comfortable,The ear pieces on these masks are amazing. They are stretchy but too much and you don't feel them pulling down on your ears. It is a very soft type of elastic. So gentle on skin too. The mask itself even being 4 ply is very comfortable to breath in. I love these face masks.,US,2020-09-28
5,"great fit, breathable & thick","These are perfect!! Size is great, they ‚Äúfan out‚Äù wonderfully. I‚Äôm a woman with a fairly small face and they fit great. they look great and I can breath through them easily. they are pretty thick, I feel very well protected. I will order more from this company if i run out. people at my office commented on how nice the black looks, black looks professional.",US,2020-12-17
5,Recommend,"I recommend these masks. I ordered them after some others that I ordered took an inordinate amount of time to arrive. These came in two days. The kids like them, BUT for my thinner faced kid, the ear loops are a tad long, so we have to use one of those ear loop holder thingees to keep it snug on his face. Fits my other more fuller faced kid just fine. Masks are soft and thick, but very breathable. I tried one to make sure.",US,2020-11-28
5,Nice change from white,"Something different than a white mask for a wedding. Plus some of the High School kids prefer black.

They seem thicker than the white masks. But, just like the white...if you aren't gentle the ear loops will break.",US,2020-09-30
5,Blue Camo Faulty Loops,"I did like the blue camouflage colors. I had recently bought the black color and was pleased with them. I really like they had 4 layers of protection. I was hesitant to buy the camo color at first only because they had only 3 layers and cost a little more. So, I figured the black one worked well, I decided to buy camo. They camouflage was ok except the loops broke. Not only one person, but others who wore them said the loop broke and each person had their own pack. Had no loop breakage from the black masks, in fact they were too loose for me. I just twisted it and they were fine. So I recommend the black mask. The blue camouflage masks, please make them with the 4 layers and reinforce the loops so they won't break from the masks.",US,2020-11-20
2,Unsure of sanitation with packaging,"Product seems fine. The kids wear them without a complaint. However, the 4th one we took out of the box had hair inside the individual packaging, so now that raises concerns I didn't have.",US,2021-01-30
3,Too big for small kids,"These seem to be well made and comparable to others I have purchased, however they are not a friendly kid size. It is too big on my 7 year old and therefore not very helpful for my classroom of kindergarteners that I bought them for. I have to tie the earpieces to make them fit.",US,2021-01-30
3,Too big for normal/average fit,"The masks were too large- the ear loops were too big, or definitely stretched. I was looking forward to receiving and using these masks, but they didn‚Äôt fit tight enough to meet health officials‚Äô recommendations. I usually wear ‚Äúnormal; average fit‚Äù masks without a problem, and so expected these to work. I have never needed a size small.",US,2020-12-11
3,Poorly designed using low quality material an lack of quality control,"The material they were made from was not very sturdy an flimsy having compared them to higher end masks!

I honestly did not feel very safe wearing these i honestly wish i could have rated them better though i sadly can not!

"""" I received this product as a free promotional item so it did not cost anything to try it! """"",US,2020-12-04
5,Definetly different than 3 ply,"My daughter was wearing 3 ply disposable masks for volleyball and I bought these 4 ply one. She noticed a difference and said they were definitely thicker but also a little harder to breathe in (probably after getting used to the 3 ply). So, that definitely says something about the quality of 4 ply, it is definitely thicker.",US,2020-12-27
5,Perfect for school,These mask look great and are well constructed.,US,2020-12-05
1,Poor Quality,I bought the 2 different models. The print with the white lines on what I though was black but it‚Äôs navy blue and I bought solid black. The solid black ones from the seller are of high quality. The mask with prints are definitely defective and the straps fall off without even putting on. They are glued on and the glue is not good,US,2020-12-17
1,"It is 3 layers mask, not 4 layers.",I brought this because the description says it is 4 layers mask. Pictures online and picture on the box are different. The ear loops cannot be an extra layer of face. Wrong description and I already have many 3 layers. Wasted my time.,US,2020-10-05
5,My son like it,"This face mask is for kids.I think the mask suitable for children aged 5-12. The quality is very good and there is 4 layers, can provent the COVID-19 during this season. The color is black. My son like it.",US,2020-10-08
5,They pass the water test!,"These came individually wrapped in the box. They initially seemed very thin, but I ran water over the outer black side and NOTHING seeped out. I feel these will be great protection during the pandemic.

I'll definitely purchase again.",US,2021-01-26
1,Don't buy these if you have allergies!,"Awful!! I've been wearing these more often due to working outside the home, and the more often I wear these, the more issues I'm having. I sneeze a lot when wearing these, and it's causing my asthma to act up and I've been having more asthma attacks. These masks are the only thing I've been doing differently. They smell awful as well. I'm going back to buying the ones I got before these and never switching again.",US,2020-12-24
5,"Great mask, not for smaller faces..","Purchased these in order to have different colors besides blue. Ok, so for my face they are kind of big, but my husband love it because they‚Äôre comfortable for him and it doesn‚Äôt hurt or pull behind ears . They don‚Äôt break like the packet of blue ones I got from another company. I will buy these again for him.",US,2021-01-08
5,Great quality,I actually love these. I have a smaller face so I wear kids sizes and these are thick...They feel like quality materials. They fit perfect.,US,2021-01-30
5,My son like them so I love them,My 7yr old love the camo print the mask fits well and not too tights. So far we've had only 3 defective mask. The strap popped during intial placement on his face. I'm not gonna drop the score as the defect ratio is ok with me. We've made it through almost 90% of the box and I satisfied.,US,2021-01-15
5,Comfortable and fits well,"The ear strap of the very first mask my husband tried on came loose... At first I thought the masks were really cheap but come to find out, they actually fit really well and look good. Also they are good colors and look better than the light blue masks that they usually wear at the hospital.",US,2021-01-02
5,Feel confident letting kids wear it,"My students are always forgetting their masks or it gets wet or broken, I got these for when they need one. They seem to have a good thickness that should provide protection, but also breathability. The kids love the color and have not complained about any lack of comfort. It's a good investment in safety.",US,2020-10-13
2,"Not durable, mask detaches from ear loop","I bought these because I read multiple reviews about how great they are; unfortunately we‚Äôve only had them a week and we‚Äôve already gone through 20 masks because they break constantly (the ear loop detaches from the mask. It‚Äôs unfortunate because they are thick, comfortable and the right size for my kids they are just not well-attached.",US,2020-10-06
5,"Large, Sturdy, and Comfortable (Navy Blue with Shapes)","I got the navy blue ones with the white, dashed line shapes, not a triangle, not sure what to call them. They fit my larger face, unlike any other mask I've worn. They're more stylish than the normal blue ones, and they're really comfortable. They seem pretty sturdy, and I'm going to re-up for another box before they disappear from Amazon.",US,2021-01-06
5,Nice quality face masks for kids,I am very happy with the Vivanaturals Disposable Face Masks. They are high quality masks that have 4 layers for better protection for my grandchildren. They are very comfortable and secure for them to wear. I feel very good about my grandchildren using these masks as they are manufactured in North America in a FDA approved facility.,US,2020-10-09
1,Quality control needed.,I put one on and it was cute...a lil tight on the face but cute. Ten minutes later the ear piece breaks. I go to get another out of the package and that one broke immediately. So 3 masks in less then an hour...thats bad quality and definitely not value for my money.,US,2021-02-04
5,GREAT!,"This mask is great quality and great fit. I have a 3 and 9 year old and it fits them both perfect. We have to tie a knot on the elastic for my 3 year old but that's it - it fits him well. the thickness is good too, it seems like solid quality and I feel safe with them wearing it.",US,2021-01-12
4,Quality good/color is wrong,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I know color can look different on phone, but these are mauve (shade of pink brown) the picture on amazon is definitely more pink. Would have chosen a different mask as I do not like mauve.
Other than color quality is good",US,2021-01-08
1,Ear loop breaks,"I wanted to like these masks. But when I got them, when I tried on the mask, the ear loop broke. Out of five masks I tried, four of them broke. Getting a refund.",US,2021-01-10
2,Many of these have a defective nylon strap.,"I like the comfort and the design of these face masks but almost half of all the masks I received have a problem with the elastic strap not staying connected to the mask.
Every one that has failed has been on the top right side of the mask...(See Photos)",US,2021-01-16
4,Awesome mask but sadly pleats face up,"I love these masks. Comfort fit and super soft. Reason for 4 stars...pleats are facing the wrong way. The picture does show them facing up and I didn't think about that till I received them. The issue with pleats facing up is that it doesn't allow particles to fall off the mask, it traps them in spaces that create pockets on the side of the mask. I'm still wearing them but not sure I would buy again unless the pleats are reversed to pointing down.",US,2021-01-13
2,Cheaply made. Straps fall off,"These masks are very cheaply made. The glue they used for the straps must be of very low quality. I used three back to back within one hour and all three had the strap come off. I was right in the middle of a store! Had it not been for my wife carrying extra in her purse, I don‚Äôt know what I would‚Äôve done!",US,2020-12-13
3,Too big for 7 years old,"First of all, if masks are black, why they have blue mask on the package. Second of all, I think they should narrow down the age range. Under description, it says 4-12 years old. My daughter is 7 years old, but the mask is too big for her. Every time she talks, her nose comes out.",US,2020-10-08
4,Soft on outside only,"These are soft on the outside, but a typical medical mask feel on the inside. I'm not sure why they wouldn't make the side against our skin the soft one? Either way, it fits and feels similar to a regular surgical mask and looks super cute with the crowns.",US,2021-01-10
5,Fabulous fashionable stylish,Oh my god there is not enough words in the human dictionary that I can say about these face mask my children love these mask because they‚Äôre so fashionable I bought the Adult size Black disposable mask and now my children can match me and be my accessory!,US,2020-12-21
4,They work well,They are comfortable to wear I feel protected by the 4ply . After wearing them all day my ears do not hurt. They are easier to breathe in than others that I have. Mine and my families only complaint would be they have a weird smell to them but not so bad we cant wear them its just weird. I would probably purchase them again.,US,2020-11-16
3,Upside down.,"When putting this mask on putting the nosepiece on your nose causes the fins to face upward creating a pocket. If they were manufactured properly, I definitely would have kept them because they were thick and also comfortable for my kids.",US,2020-10-05
5,Met expectations,Met expectations . It appears to do what us expected...an enhancement to stop the spread. I held mask up against the light and could not see through it,US,2020-11-10
1,Pleats in the wrong direction,Folds are facing up. Will be returning.,US,2020-10-20
1,Chemical Smell,These are a perfect fit for my 4 year old. However I am so disappointed that these have a factory smell to them. I wonder if it‚Äôs the smell of ink from the strawberry/donut print. I will try hanging them up to get rid of the smell before she wears them.,US,2021-01-17
5,Cute & Comfortable,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 These masks are super cute and comfortable. as a teacher I like that these are printed because they are less intimidating than the blue ones for my students. Also I like being able to take them off at the end of the day and throw them away and not risk bringing the germs from work into my home. Even though I wear glasses, the coverage offered by this masks means that my glasses don‚Äôt fog up.",US,2020-12-04
4,Thumbs Up,This is my 2nd time I bought these. They are really comfortable & breathable. The only reason why I didn‚Äôt give this 5 stars is because my package arrived open & is missing 1 mask. They are all individually wrapped so it‚Äôs easy to count them.,US,2021-01-28
1,Don't waste your money,Every single mask that I have tried to wear instantly breaks on the right side ear loop. I was able to wear ONE for a short period before it spontaneously broke on me. DO NOT waste your money.,US,2021-01-26
5,Great masks üò∑!,"These masks are great. Comfortable, and they look nice. We bought a second pack of them.",US,2021-01-30
3,Kids mask fits small adult too,Nice pattern and good quality. These kids masks happen to fit my small adult face .,US,2020-12-31
1,Listen to 1 star reviews,"I should have to listened to some of the reviews saying the pleats are upside down. Guess I hoped that those packages were the exception. But the masks I received had upside down pleats, as well. That‚Äôs a pretty big eff up. They‚Äôre also quite large, but that‚Äôs a secondary concern. I‚Äôll be returning them.",US,2020-10-21
1,Poor Quality Assurance,"I purchased 2 boxes of these and found that they are incorrectly manufactured. The pleats on the front/outside of the masks are supposed to be facing downward, which you can see that they are not. (My finger is on the metal nose band) The incorrect assembly causes difficulty for those that wear eyewear. No recourse on returning them since I had to open them up to confirm my suspicions.",US,2020-10-21
5,Excellent masks!,"These are excellent! I can actually breathe in these compared to the cloth ones I buy. Fits very snugly around the face, covering everything. Comfortable bendable nose wire, and the ear straps are not really tight and don‚Äôt hurt your ears!",US,2020-11-11
2,Bad quality,The mask is glued on so most of the masks got torn just after few mins - the sides are glued very loosely. I thought it‚Äôs just one or two but it‚Äôs all of them. Very disappointed bcz I really like the color and comfort.,US,2021-02-04
5,Comfortable and stylish,"Had to jump on the black face mask bandwagon, and have been very happy with these! Great quality from what I‚Äôve seen -no issues with ear loops falling off or the seams being upside down.. from my experience, I only have positive things to say, and would recommend them to friends/ family.",US,2021-02-04
5,By far the best I‚Äôve found!,"By far the best disposable face mask I‚Äôve bought! I was having a hard time finding some that didn‚Äôt make my face irritated when using them, I‚Äôm glad I found these! I just ordered 2 more boxes! I hope they continue stocking up and I can keep buying these same ones in the future!",US,2020-10-24
5,Fashion and function all in one package!,Very pleased with the fit of these masks. Purchased because I wanted something that was fashionable yet still functional. These masks have a very soft lining on the inside and are very comfortable to wear. The elastic ear loops are also the perfect size as to not put excessive pressure on ears. Overall very happy with this purchase.,US,2020-11-24
1,Don't Buy They Don't Work Properly,"Don't waste your money with these mask. Though the are very cute and comfortable, the ear loop strings pop off while you wear them and sometimes while putting them on making them unsafe and ineffective. Save your money and get a better quality mask elsewhere.",US,2021-01-05
1,Bad construction,The mask's earloops keep breaking and have to use more maks than planned.,US,2020-12-07
5,Overall Success,I got these for my sisters kids and easy to adjust to they fit well without falling off. The black color is good since it seems to be liked by both boys and girls. Overall would say these were a successful purchase and would buy again.,US,2020-09-26
5,Great Masks,These are very high-quality masks. They had a slight chemical odor at first but it disappeared quickly. The nose piece was easy to adjust and made for a perfect fit. Thanks to the great fit my glasses didn't fog up. The ear loops were very comfortable.,US,2020-10-24
5,Well Worth the Price!,"These disposable masks are not the regular ones you buy in the market. These masks are really thick, yet easy to still breathe. The masks are comfortable, yet still have a great fit and keep close to your face to keep out the germ spread! At times, I feel that some disposable masks feel cheap and I don't feel very safe, these masks are well worth the price you pay!",US,2020-10-21
4,masks,"Good mask, had to purchase this because the hospital I work for, any decent mask is unavailable, Go Figure! The mask is thick and comfortable, but i still feel leaks around my face I have a normal thinner facial features. I would buy these again. just wish they were a little larger. or more conforming.",US,2020-11-12
5,Do not fog my glasses at all,"Totally obsessed with these masks. They fit perfectly, they do not fog my glasses, they are thick, but it‚Äôs still easy to breath through. I will buy them again!the size is perfect for me and my husband.",US,2020-12-31
2,"No metal nose strip, upset.","Upset with the package. It was supposed to come in a day but needed up not until 5 days later. As for the product, the details said it comes with a metal
Nose strip but the first one I opened and grabbed did not it. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to leave on and wear because nothing holds the face mask in place since no metal strip on my nose which makes me unsafe because it‚Äôs not secured. I work with active kids so that is a must. The ear loops are far too large. All other adult disposable masks and ear loops have fit me fine in the past.",US,2020-11-23
3,Ear loops break super easy,"I purchased these to take on vacation, they are super cute and very soft. The problem is several loops break off when putting them on or when we removed for eating. I purchased a different type to have a variety of colors and none of those broke.",US,2021-01-18
5,Good Quality Face Masks For Kids,"These are good quality masks for kids. I'm glad I found these. My daughter, who is 4, likes pink, purple, and unicorn everything had no problem with the masks being black. She also said they were comfortable. They are perfect for school. Also, I usually buy coconut oil from this brand and was surprised to see that they made face masks for kids.",US,2020-10-12
5,"Design is pretty, its breathable, but breaks easily","The mask is comfortable, & breathable. But the glue for the strings are horrible. I've wasted 4 of them I was unable to wear them. As soon as I try to put it on the left bottom side breaks off. ü•∫",US,2021-01-05
1,Ear loops Problem,The ear loops kept falling out of the mask after wearing only a few minutes. Don't waste your money.,US,2021-02-02
2,Didn't pass the flame test,"I thought these were going to be great mask but unfortunately they are not. I did the candle test , where I try to blow out a candle while wearing it and I was able to without any issue. :-(",US,2020-12-11
4,Not 4ply lies,The description stated 4ply when I received the product it was in fact only 3ply. Masks are nice and still work I just didn't get the extra protection that I paid the extra money for.,US,2021-01-27
5,Good Fitting,"The material is pretty good. No smell whatsoever. Pretty thick. This is well suited for bigger kids. 4-5 years it is little to bigger. May be adding the clip, it will be perfect for little ones.",US,2020-11-01
5,Great Masks!,They were delivered a day early! Just in time because my daughter just wore her last mask to school today. The material is nice and the pattern is adorable! Very happy with my purchase.,US,2020-11-30
5,Good quality!,"Although it does not state ""4-ply"" on the box, they do feel a little thicker than the typical disposable masks. They arrived quickly as promised, which I appreciated. I really prefer the black color. Looks much better than the typical blue ones.",US,2020-11-12
5,beautiful and very comfortable,beautiful and very comfortable my child loved it,US,2020-12-22
5,Best 4ply mask around,"These are the best mask I have bought since this Covid-19 pandemic. They are thicker than any of the others I've bought. Comfortable and well made. I definitely will be purchasing more. The come packaged individually, 50 in box.",US,2021-01-09
4,Terrible Glue,They are stylish and not super kiddy. My 10 year old will wear them without complaint. Only issue is that the straps keep breaking. We went to a store and I always bring extra masks (kids lose them so easily) and we went through all 4 extras I had.,US,2021-01-28
5,So cute,These masks are so cute. My daughters both love them. They have a little shine to them that just adds a little extra cute factor. They fit great. They aren‚Äôt scratchy.,US,2021-01-23
5,Cute color and design. Price and quality is great!,These masks are durable and do not cause my face to break out. I actually wear each one for two days before makeup and dirt transfer. I highly recommend. A great value for the price!,US,2021-01-15
1,The ear straps break,I bought a box of these and the ear straps are constantly breaking. A few lasted a day but the majority of them had the ear strap break very quickly after putting the mask on.,US,2021-01-16
1,The straps break,"I like the look and the feel of this mask, but I am on my third mask in one day because the straps break so very easily. I will not buy again. Poor craftsmanship.",US,2021-01-29
5,Nice,"These seem almost nice enough to be re-usable. I wish the box was a tad cheaper than $20, but I think they are worth it if they hold up with a little water/mouth moisture. We'll see!",US,2020-10-15
5,Good value,Bought this for my son for those emergency days when he forgets a mask. Keep some in the car and some at home. Also great for his backpack when at the sitter. He doesnt always like to wear a mask but with the camo design hes loving it.,US,2021-01-28
5,"Lightweight, breathable","My 6 y.o loves these as soon as she put it on she was like ""I can breathe!"". We did have to put knots in the ear loop straps to make the fit a lil tighter but no complaints as they are lightweight and breatheable.",US,2020-11-09
3,Strings are not attached very well. I have had to staple them back on,"I do like this product. But not liking the strings falling off when putting them on.
Works great after I staple them back on.
Bought a pack of 50. Used 15 so far. Had to reattach 9 of them with staples.
I would have liked to have given this Mask 5 stars!",US,2021-01-28
3,Poor fitment,"4 layers as advertised, does not fit well especially the metal piece for the nose bridge.
The metal piece/wire too thin
I don't recommend this product",US,2021-01-16
2,Mask Upside Down,Upside down. Outside pleats are supposed to be facing downwards not upwards just like the pictures and Inside mask has to be fold opposite of front which is downwards.,US,2020-10-10
2,Great mask if it was made correctly,I really hate giving these a bad rating. The mask quality is actually really good. They are very comfortable and for well. You can breathe in these easily. But the pleats are upside down. I wish the company had a better quality control,US,2020-12-24
3,Defective?,"Maybe it‚Äôs just the box I got but each one I‚Äôve used so far, the ear strap has snapped off. First I thought it was me. Maybe I was too rough so I was gentle with the next but it snapped anyway. Really annoying.",US,2020-12-21
1,Save your money. These are junk,Junk! The ear loop falls off. About every 3rd Mask is trash. I‚Äôm not hard on masks at all and the ear loops just falls off. They aren‚Äôt glued good at all!,US,2021-01-04
5,Very comfortable,"Our 6 yo loves these masks, mostly because he can breathe better in them, opposed to the cloth masks. The straps are too long for his face, but like all other disposable masks, it‚Äôs easy to adjust by tying knots on end of each side for a tighter fit. And he said he can finally match his mask with all his clothes. He‚Äôs outgrown the ‚Äúchildish, yet cute‚Äù printed masks. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",US,2020-12-05
2,Yucky inside layer,"The ear loops stretch easily-too easily, and don‚Äôt go back to normal so once it‚Äôs stretched it makes the mask very loose. The inside cotton layer became very ‚Äúhairy‚Äù as my 6 yr old said by end of school day, which made it uncomfortable since it‚Äôs rubbing his mouth. Good value for the pack but won‚Äôt be buying again, back to homemade cloth masks for us that have adjustable ties.",US,2020-11-18
5,Great quality product,"I ordered again and my package arrived a day early. Good quality masks, breathable and easy to take off and on. The quality of these masks is as advertised. I like the black color for more formal events as well.",US,2021-01-05
3,OK masks,"The mask feels thicker than the regular disposable masks but the ear loops are too big for my 5 and 8 year-old kids. Tying a small knot helps the mask to stay in place. Also, the masks have open see-through holes on the top and bottom part, I checked the other masks and they have some type of clear protection but not these ones. I am only using these masks as back up in case my kids lose the regular mask they wear.",US,2020-10-29
5,Size perfect for some adults very nicely.,"I bought for myself.
Adult musks are big for me. It fits me perfectly.",US,2021-01-13
1,Poor quality,"Didn't like the mask poor quality,the inside is so irritating as the strings keep coming in the mouth.",US,2021-01-15
5,Perfect for school,My kids (10 and 11) said that the cloth masks were not as comfortable as these. They wear these every day to school and don't have any trouble with ear pulling or discomfort.,US,2020-12-12
5,My kids loved it.,"Size is perfectly fit for my kids, 11, 9 and 7 years old.

They said, black color masks are cool.. lol

Thanks!",US,2020-09-21
3,"Cute, but not super protective.","People always ask where‚Äôd I get my mask from.
They certainly do go with every outfit. However, they aren‚Äôt super protective because I did the lighter test (lit a match to see if I‚Äôd be able to blow out the fire with the mask on) and I was able to blow out the fire with little effort.",US,2020-11-23
5,High-quality,This mask is made of high-quality material. The loops are extra stretchy so that it can give you a better fit. There is also an adjustable nose guard for a better fit.,US,2021-01-06
3,Fits nice but smells ‚Äú/,"I liked that these fit my small face like a glove. However, these masks have a very weird stench that gives me a boarder line headache. At first I thought maybe it was my breath LOL. But absolutely not, It must be from the materials. I‚Äôve tried ‚Äúairing‚Äù them out but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll help.

The smell is mostly pronounced where the nose guard is too.",US,2020-10-08
1,Folds are the wrong way not sure if it was defective,Unfortunately the folds in these masks are the wrong way. Folds are to go downward not upward and these go upward not sure if it was a defect or if they're all like that. The other pack from the same brand we ordered for kids was fine. Amazon was kind to refund them since they were defective I am guessing,US,2020-12-12
5,My boys love them,"My kids love them. Wear them daily to school and really everywhere we go. I like them because they are disposable. So I carry extra in my purse in case they lose them, or they get soiled. This is my 3rd box.",US,2021-01-19
5,High quality disposable masks,High quality masks that last. Great value. Perfect for looking put together but with the ease of disposal. Must have for those times that you need a mask and a reusable one isn‚Äôt available. Also great for guests.,US,2020-10-19
5,Great for large faces,I have a large face and larger ears. This mask fit perfectly. The elastic doesn't last as long as others. But it doesn't cut my ears off either.,US,2020-11-28
3,Keeps me alive,Comfortable,US,2021-01-23
1,Junk!,Nicely packed box of 50 masks. Put one on and ear loop popped off mask. Tried two more and same exact thing happened. Returned for refund!,US,2021-01-08
5,Worth the money,"I wasn‚Äôt too sure bout this masks special because I‚Äôm a guy with a big head and most of the other mask hurt my ears but theirs ones are just perfect.
Wifey loves them too",US,2021-01-21
4,Who wouldn't love pink crown masks?!?,"They are very cute, fun and comfortable to wear. Only issue is size, they are pretty big and slide up my face into my eye. Constantly having to pull down. Otherwise, I am very happy with purchase.",US,2020-12-22
5,Really enjoy these masks,They‚Äôre thick and comfortable to wear. It‚Äôs not bothersome to wear for long periods of time. *not recommended for medical use just for everyday wear when out,US,2020-10-15
4,Affordable,"They are thicker than the ones I've normally bought, which was good it was nice to have that kind of protection. I would definitely purchase in the future",US,2021-01-05
1,Bait and Switch - Buyer Beware,Bait and switch! Don't waste your money. It is not a 4 ply mask. They count the ear loops as a ply. Very thin material. I can blow out a candle with this mask on. Be safe and do not order thinking that you will be safe from Covid!,US,2020-12-29
5,Nice,My nieces loves them. I was able to keep some and give rest to my sister-in-law. When my nieces came over they fogot to bring theirs over. Adult masks just don't fit them.,US,2021-01-09
5,Good disposable kids masks,"Just like any other disposable face mask. Fits my 8yr old Daughter perfectly and she wears them to school all day, no pulling on the ears like other masks.",US,2020-10-03
5,Comfort and stylish,"Very comfortable.
I'm a bartender and i wear one a day for 8 hours.
I like the smaller fit on my face. The straps are long enough for my face.",US,2020-10-24
4,Gaps,Nice that it has 4 layer protection and thicker than the 3 ply disposable. The only downside to this mask is that it's better for larger faces. Even tying knots in the ear loops left the mask the sides of the mask would not stay flush with my cheeks. As I have a couple boxes I'll probably use some mask tape with these.,US,2021-01-29
4,‚ÄúManageable‚Äù,"Maybe my face is a bit small for this mask because it kept sliding down but everyone face isn‚Äôt the same size., however I did do the candle test and it did not go out. Yes I would purchase again because it‚Äôs manageableüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä",US,2020-12-15
5,Perfect masks for small-faced adults,"I got these masks because I have a very small face, and normal surgical masks are huge on me. They are perfect, no need to tie the strings. The 4 layers are noticeable and you feel protected all the time.",US,2021-01-27
4,Quality masks and Perfect suit for Kids,"Quality of the mask and the thread is great and suitable for my kids, In fact suitable for adults who are having small faces.
My kid is only 6 yr old so we had to loop the thread to fit into ears. Good thing is it was packed into 4 smaller units inside the box, so if you open 1 unit, so still another 3 units are still untouchable in good storage conditions.",US,2020-11-15
5,No fog for kids with glasses,"This is the first mask that my 14 y/o petite daughter can wear without getting her glasses fog up.
It does have some plasticy smell though.",US,2020-11-15
4,Stylish. Comfortable. Allergic reaction,Love that they were individually packaged. Fit was great and comfortable. Something in the material made my face burn and feel really irritated. Gave to some friends and they have no issue.,US,2021-01-24
5,Love them!,These look and feel so nice! My son has sensory processing issues and has trouble with things on or around his mouth. These work so well for him!,US,2020-10-06
1,AVOID At ALL COST !,These are the worse masks ever. EVERY ONE of the straps just fall off. Unable to use. If you see how the strap just lays on inside layer with little to no adhesive to secure it. Guess you can attempt to add glue but it will probably irritate face. Have bought many mask on Amazon from other sellers with no problem so it is a problem with this particular product.,US,2020-12-28
5,so cute!,"love the pattern and they are great masks. A bit big, so I just tie a little knot so it won't try to slip up to my eyes lol!",US,2021-01-15
5,Excelente !,"Son excelentes y muy c√≥modas, el problema es que una gran cantidad vinieron defectuosas sin el el√°stico, pero el vendedor es muy eficiente y me resolvi√≥ el problema en 1 d√≠a. Lo recomiendo y volver√© a comprar con ellos. Son confiables.",US,2020-12-09

5,Good for petite adults too,I have a small face and these fit me well as an adult. I feel safer with these since they are more snug being kids size.,US,2021-02-03
5,Cute Patterns,Very cute masks. My daughter loves them. These are 3 ply so a bit thicker than normal and recommended for better protection.,US,2020-12-15
2,Nice enough but not as thick as I would have liked,The folds go up instead of down for one and the fourth ply they consider the string that goes behind your ears. I wanted something thicker,US,2020-11-13
3,Look cute but not really usable,"Kids refuse to wear them, they say they are ichy. When my kids where them, they‚Äôre are pockets on side that offer no protect.",US,2020-12-04
5,Nice masks,"Love the thickness, mask is a bit large for my child, but with an adjustment to the elastic (I tied a knot,] it's fine",US,2020-12-16
3,Not Happy,The elastic bands are so fragile and break constantly. I‚Äôve had to throw out so many masks because the elastic broke.,US,2020-12-28
5,Good quality for the price!,"Well packaged (taped and packaged in 5 packs of 10. No smell. Thick, but breathable fabric! Fits perfect for men and women. Felt comfortable with full day wear.",US,2020-10-15
2,WAY too big for my kids,"First of all it smells. Also these are more adults or at least teenager sized masks. They fit me and my husband, but way too big for our average sized 8 year old. This is the third type of kids masks I‚Äôve purchased through Amazon and this is the only type that didn‚Äôt fit my kid.",US,2020-11-13
4,Better than most disposable mask.,I would have given it 5 stars if the ear elastic didn‚Äôt break so often! About 1/3 mask the elastic snaps .. other than that they are comfy and thick but yet breathable. Great for kids and small faces .,US,2021-01-03
5,nice,I bought for my grandsons school the teachers asked for extra mask for the children and this mask is wonderful,US,2021-02-05
5,Very comfortable,These masks are thick but very breathable. The earloops are comfortable and I have not had a single one break on me. I love the black color - they match my outfits!,US,2020-10-22
5,Great masks,These masks are great. They fit better than some other masks and have 4 layers. They are softer on my face and I have less irritation.,US,2021-02-01

1,"very poor quality, defective product",Used the first five of these masks and with each one an ear loop string snapped off within the first 10 minutes.,US,2021-01-23
4,Daily user!,Super cute! I've gotten so many compliments on these masks! They are very comfortable and breathable as well. I just wish they had more designs rather than having just one.,US,2021-01-11
3,Ok buy,Bought box of fifth. The first mask lasted a few hours before the elastic ear loop broke. You think twice.,US,2021-02-05
5,Well made 3 ply mask,"Bought this color for my husband. He says they are comfortable, an excellent form fit, and do not fog up his glasses.",US,2020-11-18
3,the masks I received are sewn upside down. the pleats go up!,"Pleats are supposed to go down. Your pictures indicate they are properly made. the ones I received are not.

That being said - I pretty much spread them out so maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter so much? I still got a refund.

Also I have been tacking down a pleat to a lower pleat (at the two edges) to get a tighter fit. I‚Äôve had to do that with all masks.",US,2020-09-29
2,Cute but too big for little kids,These are cute but they are huge on my 4 year old (almost 5 year old‚Äôs face). They fit me better than her.,US,2021-02-04
3,Smelly,Very comfortable and the thickness is great. Fit is a little big and they do have an odor to them that I did not notice in the kid‚Äôs size that we also purchased.,US,2020-10-12
3,Damaged box,"I received these and the box was damaged/ torn and there were not 50 in the box. I returned them.
They were individually wrapped though.",US,2021-01-27

5,Stylish and comfortable for my kids,Excellent. Very comfortable and fit my kids perfectly. Kept a stash in their backpacks so they were never without.,US,2020-12-21
5,Best disposable masks I've tried.,These are the best quality disposable masks we have tried. They fit the kids perfect. I have a smaller face and they fit me too. Would definitely buy again. In fact I already have ordered a box in adult size.,US,2020-12-22
5,Quality,"I like that these masks look a lot better in public than the standard blue ones. I like the metal nose piece, if I do it right my glasses fog up less or not at all.",US,2020-12-10
1,Not impressed,Box was damaged and mask plastic tampered with. Not good look. Tried one to see elasticity. Not good.,US,2021-01-02
2,Too Big for Children,Ordered for my 6 year old and 9 year old. They are way too big and don't seal correctly on the sides of their faces. I am wondering if these are intended to fit 12 or 13 year olds.,US,2021-01-13
5,Perfect for my 11 year old!,"My 11 year old son really likes this mask. I haven't bought any other disposable, except for this one. TY!",US,2020-12-17
5,Fits small adult faces too!,I'm an adult but regular masks are too big on me so I bought these hoping they would get better. They fit me perfectly! They're thick yet breathable and great quality materials. Would definitely buy again!,US,2020-10-17
1,Incorrect pleat direction and loops too long!,"These masks are incorrectly made. The pleats are upside down! They are going in the incorrect direction for safety. Another reviewer also commented on this, but I gave it a chance and ordered these masks. I‚Äôm disappointed in the quality. The loops are quite long and some are different lengths. Too big for my face and when you wear the mask the sides gap which is also not safe.",US,2020-10-17
5,Nicce and thick!!!,I love these disposable masks. They are comfortable and I feel confident with the extra layer for protection.,US,2021-01-23
4,Kids face mask,I got these for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party for guest to wear. I didn‚Äôt any problems with it at the party. I had extra and the ear loop break each time with prolonged use.,US,2020-12-17
4,Very good,I was very happy until I read another purchasers review. I checked mine. The pleats are upside down. Does it matter?,US,2020-11-21
3,Just okay,"I wear masks all of the time for work. I work in the medical field. That being said, these masks were very itchy on my face, and the nose piece is plastic and won't hold firmly in place.",US,2021-01-11
5,great mask for smaller faces!,"these fit well, they're very attractive and they seem like they're very sturdy and thick.",US,2020-12-18
1,Straps will snap before you even put it on,It took me 6 masks to find the one that ‚Äúwon‚Äôt‚Äù snap before you even put it on. I went into the store and even that one snapped and fell...the mask itself looks like a good quality but the straps snaps right away!!! Waste of my $10!! All in the trash can now...,US,2020-12-17
3,Box was ripped apart but masks weren‚Äôt tampered with or contaminated. Still doing it‚Äôs purpose.,It fits just right on my 5 & 3 year old. It doesn‚Äôt really irritate my sons skin (he has eczema) and it feels really secure and safe. The only think I wanna complain about is receiving my package torn up and everything thrown into a clear bag. The masks themselves had their own wraps that weren‚Äôt tampered with but I would still like to receive my packages not damaged.,US,2021-01-13
2,"Not for little kids, will probably fit teens","I like that it is 4 ply.

I don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs too big for my kids and too small for adults",US,2020-10-26

First time ever.",US,2021-02-04
5,Comfortable Fit. Well Made,"These masks seem very well made and are surprisingly comfortable. The box they came in was pretty mangled but the masks inside were fine. I do wish they were individually packaged, but that's not a deal breaker.",US,2020-11-22
5,Thick!,These are pretty thick which I love!!! Small enough for a child or adult with a small face like myself!,US,2020-12-04
5,Perfect for the cause!,Super cute and so far no issues with any breaking! Great for kids and small adults!,US,2021-01-27
1,No comprar,Cada vez que intentas colocarte las mascarilla se le parte el el√°stico. De las 59 solo pude usar solo 10.,US,2021-01-19
5,Great quality,These masks are great. They are very comfortable and easy to breathe in. They are great for a socially distant night out because the black looks better with outfits than the standard blue mask. The masks a very thick and sturdy so no worries with them.,US,2020-10-06
1,Deceptive advertising,"Advertising is deceptive. Packaging claims the masks are ""Made with four layers"": Outer layer, Middle layer, Inner layer, and Ear Loops. How can one identify ear loops as a layer. These are three layer masks, not four layer masks.",US,2020-11-04
1,Not safe,Not pass the cigarette lighter test!It blew out the lighter!Shouldn‚Äôt blow outNot safe unless wear 2 together !,US,2021-01-15

5,Don't return before looking at the bottom of the box for content label.,The box looked like I received blue masks but the label on the bottom of the box shows the actual color contents. I almost returned them because I thought that I received the wrong package. The masks are in great condition and as described.,US,2021-01-03
5,Good buy,Good buy for my 12 yr old and aunt who has a smaller face and has to wear kids masks,US,2021-01-28

5,Great mask,This mask was so comfortable I forgot I had it on! Great quality awesome price,US,2021-02-01
3,None,These are nice masks but not any larger or longer for men. They did not fit my husband.,US,2021-02-01
5,Nice quality.,"These probably are the best quality masks I‚Äôve ever purchased on Amazon. The ear loops are very comfortable, the fabric is thick so it actually can hold itself up and not stick to my nose and mouth, makes it a lot easier to breath. Highly recommend.",US,2020-10-25
2,Ear straps failing,"Maybe it was a bad batch, but the ear straps pulled right off the masks. Our son went through 15 masks his first day back at school. Sent the first pack back. Trying again with a reorder because they are soft and camo is a great pattern. Hoping we just got a bad batch the first time - if so we'll update this review.",US,2021-02-01
5,Good quality masks,My son loves these masks. They fit well and are well made. They have plenty of layers and look nice.,US,2020-09-25

5,"Thick , sturdy and comfortable",Wow is all I can say! My son begged for a black mask like me and I bought him these!!! The ear loop is comfortable! The mask come individually wrapped! WOW !!! Nice bang for my dollar . The box has a cut out top as if you were reselling. Not an bad ideal actually ü§£,US,2021-01-20
4,"Good, comfortable, four ply masks.","Comfortable, easy to put on, handy to grab and go, four ply for protection",US,2021-01-09
5,Comfortable,My 10 year old son loves this mask. Says it‚Äôs more comfortable than any cloth mask we have tried. Fits well and he says he can wear it comfortably for the 4 hours he‚Äôs in school.,US,2021-01-14

4,"Good masks, would buy again","These are great disposable masks. I like having them in my car so I can quickly grab one when I go through drive thrus or pump gas. I've also used them while working in my yard outdoors. Besides getting very hot, they do a good job of keeping debris out of my nose and mouth.",US,2020-11-12
5,Good ones!,"Nice quality, beautiful print, great price! would buy it again.",US,2021-01-15
4,Very Big for Small Faces,"Seems well made, but way too big for my 4.5 yr old. I hope knotting the ear strings will allow for a safe fit.",US,2020-09-23
5,Breathable and comfortable,Love how breathable and comfortable these are. Dont feel hot and thick like most do,US,2020-10-12
5,Comfortable fit for kids,Purchased these for the grand kids and they seem to really like them. They fit kids much better than regular sizes and for the amount that you get I believe it was a good value.,US,2020-12-26
4,Package was damage in transit,Missing 3 masks!! Box was torn open and some mask was coming out of back. See pictures.,US,2021-02-03
4,Great masks!!,Great mask!! Really like it!! Love the individual packaging!!,US,2021-01-31
2,Poor quality,I would not recommend this mask due to the ear straps detaching from the mask much to easily making them useless. Some are ok but way to many in the box have this issue. I returned the original purchase and ordered a new box but same issue. Otherwise no other complaints. If they can work on quality control and correct the issue I would purchase again.,US,2021-02-04

5,Cute designs,These are very thick masks and work perfect for children or for adults with smaller faces. The mask fit very well and have a cute design.,US,2020-12-21
2,Defective Batch,Purchased the kids size as I have a tiny face. Fits worse than the adult. I can cut the adult on the sides to fit but kids just sticks out causing a gap which defeats the purpose of the mask. Also the metal nose piece was put on the bottom of the mask so when wearing the nose piece on the nose the folds don't lay right.,US,2020-11-21
5,Comfortable mask,"Good quality better than most products out of market , fits well and comfortable also breathe easy, perfect for kid or any girl with small face :)",US,2020-09-26

4,"Good product, did not break","Good product, my kids did not complain. Straps did not break.",US,2020-12-08
4,Great face mask,"I would recommend these face masks because they are comfortable, and if color coordination is important, the black will go with everything. The fact that they are individually wrapped is a big plus.",US,2021-01-29
2,Not worthy,"I was so excited to get these pink face masks with crowns on them, but unfortunately they are not what I was hoping for. The color is actually a rusty mauve. And the strap has come apart from the mask on several already, they are not well made. Very disappointed.",US,2021-01-14
5,Definitely 4ply. I apologize for doubting,"Good value, though initially I thought they were not 4ply I posted this photo of one I cut to see the inside. Clearly 4ply just very thin, but tightly woven.",US,2021-01-21
1,BREAKS AS SOON AS YOU PUT IT ON!!,This product is terrible. The elastic that goes around your ears is SOOOO terribly glued that it lets loose as soon as you put them on. I have had eight...yes EIGHT of them break already. ONE of them I was able to wear longer than 15 minutes...then it broke. To be honest there were inexpensive and that matches their quality. Waste of money!!,US,2021-01-08

5,Good deal,Good quality and super cute. Great price.,US,2020-12-18
5,Good mask,Most comfortable mask we have tried yet.,US,2020-12-10
4,Hoped for a better fit,Find that the masks are shorter than expected from nose to chin. Might be better for smaller faces. Found that masks slip above chin with frequency. Also found that the metal nose piece doesn‚Äôt hold shape well causing glasses to fog. Liked 5 separate packs of 10 each. Fortunately not expensive. Will share with my Mom & kids.,US,2020-12-13
5,I love these masks!!,These disposable masks are perfect. They are made really well. They fit great. I love that they don't look like a surgical mask. They are stylish but disposable. Trust me you will love them. Give them a try!!!,US,2020-11-25

1,DO NOT BUY,"Literally a waste of money, I probably can‚Äôt even return these because half of them have busted while i try putting them on.

1,Very Fragile Masks,"I purchased several of these masks for a recent trip. When I arrived at my location I took out a mask and as I was putting it on, the elastic broke.

2,Extremely Cheaply Made!,"This mask is so cute! But, this mask is so cheaply made. The ear straps break while putting on. I tried 1 it broke, then a 2nd it broke, then a 3rd same thing!

4,A Formal Designed Disposable Face Mask That Fits Most Adults And Protects Against Air Particles,"# My Review
This review is for a 50 Pack of Formal Designer Disposable Face Masks For Adults by Viva Naturals. Looking for a mask that provides the perfect fit, protection, comfort, has been hit or miss with so many to choose from. That said, I was skeptical on this offering as it appears that others have reported issues; however, I‚Äôve tried these and haven‚Äôt experienced the same - they worked fine for me!

First of all, these disposable face masks are packaged in a Viva Naturals branded box that describes the product details, contents, directions of use, etc. Inside the box are 5 packs of individually wrapped bags with 10 disposable face masks in each.

The formal design style is a navy-colored face mask with a broken line pattern. These face masks provide 3 layers of protection; there‚Äôs an outer non-woven polyester cloth, a middle non-woven melt blown cloth, and an inner non-woven cloth. I wasn‚Äôt sure what a melt blown cloth was; however, doing some research found out that it‚Äôs a non-woven sheet made of special ultra-fine fibers that are developed using a specialized process to provide enhanced level of protection from even the smallest particles present in the air like dust, bacteria and other allergens. I‚Äôm happy to see that there‚Äôs a barrier against air-borne particles from getting through. One thing to mention is that the product description does say it‚Äôs non-medical. The mask provides a comfortable fit around the nose and mouth area and is wide enough for good coverage. The nose strip works as expected and binds well over the nose to provide a secure fit. The ear loops are elastic that pull over the ears and allow for a decent fit around the face that doesn‚Äôt feel tight or restrictive. I did a pull test and stretched out the ear loops with a lot of force and pressure and the loops remained intact and didn‚Äôt come apart.

Overall, the comfort, fit and coverage of these face masks are good. These are worth a try.

5,Better Than Average As Single Use Non-Medical Masks Go,"Review of Cool Face Masks for Men (50 Pack) - 3-Ply Mens Face Mask, Premium Designer Navy Blue Face Mask for Men with Comfortable Earloops & Adjustable Nose Strip sold by Viva Naturals.

Have never noted an expiration date on non-medical masks before but this listed both production date and an expiration date approximately 21 months from date of receipt.

Reviews for various sizes and colors are mixed together. I received the Designer Navy Blue adult sized mask. The color should not impact function but the size does.

The dimensions shown in the seller‚Äôs images are accurate (6.9 x 3.7 inches or 17.5 x 9.5 cm). For US adult males the height (nose to chin) may be a bit short and the mask may therefore ride or shift when talking or performing any strenuous activity

The masks that I received had the pleats properly orientated but I also noted that perhaps 50% of the seller‚Äôs images for color show the pleats in the wrong direction. Having the pleats face downward greatly reduces the mask riding upwards as the jaw moves up and down.

The masks were packaged 10 masks per plastic envelop. This is great as it helps avoid spilling masks out, allows storage of a small ‚Äúemergency‚Äù supply in a vehicle and keeps any dust, etc., from accumulating.

The nose bridge is just a thin wire but works well enough especially considering that these are intended for single use. It may take some work to get the bends just right but these seem to fit well enough with glasses.

The ear loops are the common elastic type fabric and do have one of the adjusting collars but that is expected for single use masks. The elastic cord is acceptable in terms of comfort.

Overall, these are pretty good as single use masks go.

I did cut into one mask after use and verified that there are three layers. I am not expert enough to verify the materials but the middle layer does look and feel like melt-blown polypropylene and the outer and inner layers are listed as non-woven polyester and non-woven polypropylene, respectively.",US,2020-12-20
5,Really well made and comfortable!,"Cool Face Masks for Men (50 Pack) - 3-Ply Men's Face Mask, Premium Designer Navy Blue Face Mask for Men with Comfortable Earloops & Adjustable Nose Strip

This is tied with one other disposable mask I have tried for my favorites. I love getting away from the standard blue/white masks. These are so much more comfortable than those and the mask part feels a little thicker with these. I do like that these are the perfect in-between size where anyone in my house can use them. I have a large head and many of the masks are too small for me, these fit me well but aren't huge so my roommates or even my niece can use them.

Pros-
Good size. Able to fit on me when most masks are too small, but not so big that others in my house can't use them.

Love the color/design. They don't stand out but at the same time, they look good compared to the standard medical grade disposable ones.

Good price for the quality and quantity.

I also like how they seal in separate bundles so you can give a

The mask part feels well made with several distinguishable layers.

Cons-
Really none, If I were to be a little picky the box they come in is a little cheap looking but that's really not important at all.

Overall this is a great listing. Affordable, good quality, great fit/look. I would definitely reorder these and at this point, you really can't ever have too many masks. This is a great choice if you have a family where you need ones that for the most part will fit everyone in the house. With children, these may still be a bit too large especially for the younger ones but overall these are a nice in the middle size that will work for most people.

The label as this being a listing for men doesn't quite make sense to me. These in no way strike me as gender-specific. I actually find these very much gender-neutral.",US,2020-12-30
3,Love the masks but the elastic ear straps break easily.,"I got the blue with white design called Formal Designer. The masks come wrapped packs of five sets of 10 masks each which I like to keep them free of germs and allergens until they are opened. The box was a hot mess, falling apart, so I ditched that and put the masks in a big Ziploc bag.

They are very nice looking and fit even larger faces well. The nose wire is thin but works to hold the mask securely and I think they look really nice. I can breathe well when I wear this mask which I cant do with some others I own. I was ready to rate higher but my son, who took 10 to wear, said that two of his masks popped and broke when they were on his face. He has an average sized head and face and is careful when putting masks on. The elastic just popped and left him unprotected. My husband also likes these but today, he went to put one on and the elastic broke when he went to hook it over his ear. Not cool.

Everything else about these seems to be really good but we are wasting masks because the elastic straps aren't secure. It's also alarming that they would pop and break while on someone's face because that leaves that person vulnerable to bacteria and germs (both giving and receiving) and, if they don't have a spare with them, without a mask to wear. Better quality control on the elastic ear loops is needed. Otherwise, these masks are good for men and women.",US,2020-12-02
2,Smelly and runs a bit large,"Unfortunately I won't be wearing these as they smell pretty awful which is a shame as I really like the design. Maybe if they are left outside their bag for some time the smell will go away, I'll need to give it a go but its a bit disappointing.

There are a few more issues, for me at least. they run a bit large so people with smaller face won't be able to use it. Ear loops connection to the mask seems to be prune to failure and they suggest that you can knot the ear loops to adjust the size but I found it made it to tight of a fit more me.

Overall, It could have worked, even with the ear loops and specially with the design but I just couldn't;t get over the smell...",US,2020-12-02
5,"Super Thick, Soft, Breathable- Excellent Disposable Face Mask","These face masks by Viva Naturals are probably the nicest disposable face masks I have ordered off Amazon. Read the website for all their specific details. I‚Äôll just highlight my experience.

They are thick yet breathable- much thicker than other disposables I have used. It says there are three layers. It feels soft, most particularly the outer layer. I like the navy blue color, and the white dotted line pattern is interesting. The ear loops are stretchy and comfortable. The nose piece bends perfectly and keeps its shape- my glasses don‚Äôt get fogged up like with some that don‚Äôt bend well at the nose.

I‚Äôm just really happy with the way they fit and feel. They look well made and I just don‚Äôt have any complaints. At the current price of $8.49 for 50 masks, I think this is great value, especially considering the quality. Another nice touch is that they don‚Äôt just come in a box, but are also sealed in plastic in sets of 10.

I don‚Äôt really understand why they say these are for men; they seem neutral in my opinion.

I would definitely recommend these for others to use. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!",US,2020-12-26
4,Great masks!,"These earlooped face masks in Blue with a white design *Formal Designer) are very comfortable. I love that they feature a metal nose strip - while it is pretty thin it still works well enough to mould the mask over your nose bridge. I use these when I am working outside in the garden, cleaning my house, working on restoring furniture and when on pooper scooper duty in the yard. I am able to breath easily when wearing the 3-ply mask - of course there is always humidity and moisture when wearing a mask but I did not find this to be worse than other masks I normally wear. The loops are soft and very sturdy as my three year old was able to wear one (with the loops tied a bit tighter) for about an hour on and off and such before it broke. The loops are comfortable and I have not had any issues with them causing discomfort or pain on my ear. The nose bridge is pretty wide and easy to adjust or readjust if need be.

These also work well for when going grocery shopping or having to be out in public.

Remember the white part goes inside by your face.

These are great masks and I am so happy to have found a brand that sells both kids/adult sizes in multiple color combinations at a very fair price.",US,2020-12-02
5,An Upgrade To The Normal Disposable Mask,"What's not to love about these mask. First with everyone having to wear these daily, why not make wearing them as much fun as possible. I mean I understand the reason we are wearing them isn't pleasant or fun but when kids break there arm people decorate the cast. So why shouldn't we try and make wearing these masks as fun and as safe as possible. So lets talk about safety. The masks have 3 layers instead of 2 which is great. They have the bendable nose piece so you get a good fit around your face. As for comfort the ear straps are extremely soft and really stretchy. So they are soft to wear around your ears even for long periods of time.
I also really that they don't put all 50 in one sealed bag. Having them in several bags really makes it easy to keep the extras clean and sanitary. I have actually had several people ask me where I got the masks since I have been wearing them. I think many people are getting sick of wearing the standard doctor looking ones as this pandemic lingers on. Overall they are perfect for our needs and they look great too!",US,2020-12-03
4,Nice but small,"These are a nice upgrade - at least visually - from the throwaway surgical masks everyone seems to be wearing these days. They're stylish, with a pattern that's a little more elegant than the usual, and perfect for a man or a woman. It's a deep navy with white accents, and almost looks like a cloth mask. The benefit to these is that they're still easy to toss at the end of the day, but they've got a lot more personality than the traditional blue surgical masks.

Where these falter for me a little is the actual function. The ear strings are very small and much more likely to snap during the day. The actual masks are also on the smaller side, so they cover less of your face than some others. Whether that's a problem for you will depend on your face shape and size, etc. I can't vouch for the number of layers, but they don't seem to be any thicker than others I've used. So if you're looking for fashion more than function, these are a nice option, but I'd be wary of using them in a high risk situation.",US,2020-12-20
4,It's more stylish but still just a basic mask.,"It's a world of masks and this is part of that now. I got these because I was tired of just the plain light blue masks that was all around so I wanted something a little darker so it wasn't always such a clash against the rest of my outfit. This delivered on that.

The mask is 3-ply (I cut one open); it's the Outer layer, middle insert, and inner layer. Pleated to expand on your face and fit just like all the other standard surgical masks I have of the same style. The loops provide enough space even for my above average size head (big head) and didn't cause any unusual ache. I don't get to show off the design as much at this point since I also wear a cloth mask on top of these but I still like the look of them and when things clear up a bit I expect to get more of these for every day use. After what we went through I'm good with masking up in public all the time now.

So nothing special, a good alternative look to the normal, 3-ply basic level protection.",US,2021-02-04
4,"Nice fitting, nose piece. A little itchy","I am a swim coach and the kids are required to wear masks, or they are refused entry to the building and their practice. I have a couple kids who's parents are divorced or have other issues that cause the child to end up without a mask through no fault of their own. For those rare cases, I like to have an option for them that does not involve sitting outside until their parent returns or my spending an arm and a leg.
These are great disposable masks and per mask are cheaper than what I was able to buy locally.
Size wise these are right for 13 year olds through adult. The younger kids have a hard time keeping them on. Construction is good but these ARE disposable masks. The ear straps are nice, stretchy and comfortable. They are secure and do not pull out. The seams are strong and there is a metal nose piece to help mold around the nose and not allow glasses to fog. The mask is soft but a little itchy, especially around the chin.
Made in China. Expiration date was 8/31/2022",US,2020-12-06
4,"Thicker than most disposables, breathable and stylish. Definitely fits a man's face better.","I ordered these for my spouse and they definitely fit his face a little better than they fit mine. They're just a little too big for me. I like that they're three layers of non-woven with a melt blown in the middle. From what I gather, that is supposed to be a little bit safer. That your loops are comfortable and they fit him very well. The metal nose strip is definitely a little more hardy than other disposable masks that I've tried, as is the mask itself. It conforms very well to your nose and overall is comfortable. I am surprised that the breathability of this mask and honestly it's something that's a little less boring that my spouse is still comfortable with wearing. Oddly enough, he doesn't like plain. Overall, definitely good value as he wears these to work everyday now. I think we may end up ordering these again next month as he likes these better than the blue disposables provided by his work.",US,2020-12-09
5,"Excellent masks, thick but breathable and smell nice","I have tried several different models of these 3 layer / 4 layer breathable masks these past couple of months and these are by far the best we have had.
Although this is a 50 pack, but they come in 5 smaller packs of 10 each. You don't need to open the whole 50 at the same time.
I've done the candle blow test with them and they are really layered and safe.
The black color give it a cool look in my opinion.
The quality of the elastic band and the mask itself is very good.
The mask and band is designed toward really large faces and heads so if you have an average head, chances are this might be a bit big for you. What I did was to form a knot in the elastic band to make it a bit shorter.
And one last thing that's different from most other masks that I've tried is that these smell like a new car for some reason which I love!",US,2020-11-14
4,Not just for dudes,"I have the ‚ÄúFormal Designer‚Äù color option, in Adult size. I noticed some of the different color options have pleats going different ways, or some are aimed at men. The Formal Designer color is aimed at men, but really, the masks fit anyone.

The masks pass the candle test.

The masks are slightly softer on the outside printed layer than the white inner layer, but they are comfortable to wear and don‚Äôt irritate my skin. They have a slight chemical scent. The masks have adjustable nose wires and stretchy ear loops.

I like that the masks come bundled in packs of 10. There are 5 sealed bags inside the box, which is nice because that way you don‚Äôt get all the masks grubby when you‚Äôre pulling one out. The box can also double as a dispenser, it has a perforated top.

The masks were made in China.",US,2020-12-15
5,High quality and comfortable,"I ordered the Cool Face Masks for Men (50 Pack) in the ""formal designer"" colour, which arrived looking just like in the photos. Navy blue with some white designs on the masks. I think they're really attractive and if you're concerned about an understated non-medical look that will match a lot of outfits, this is for you. If you don't care what it looks like, it's also perfect for you. Great for any gender or age (with an adult-sized face.)

These masks are lightweight and comfortable to wear. There is a nose wire that allows me to customize the fit, and get a secure fit away from my eyes. The masks are easy to breathe through and talk through, and they filter out the allergens I'm concerned about. I definitely recommend these high quality masks.",US,2020-12-27
5,Disposable 3-ply Surgical Style Non-Medical Masks - Navy Blue Pattern 50 count,"These 3-ply non-medical surgical-style disposable masks have a distinctive color and pattern but offer the same basic protection of the plainer versions. The in-house adult male has an extra-large hat size head and these masks fit him perfectly. There is a piece of bendable metal in the top edge so the fit can be customized around the nose.

The ear loops use 1/8 inch elastic which because of the slim profile I find more comfortable to wear but that varies by individual. I was impressed that if pulled the elastic resist separating from the mask unlike that some that easily pull out. I cut open one mask to confirm that there are in fact 3 layers, and there are. The masks were manufactured in 2020 and they have an expiration date 2 years in the future. Excellent.",US,2020-12-03
5,Works as Well as Any Other Disposable Face Mask,"The Viva Naturals Men Face Masks are a good set of ‚Äúone use‚Äù masks to have on hand should you forget your reusable one. I'm not sure why these masks are marketed specifically to men as they work just as well on women.
Perhaps is because of the color or design, but to be honest, I thought the masks looked pretty gender neutral. The masks are comfortable to wear, has a small metal band on top to ensure a secure fit across the bridge of your nose, and are thick but not so thick that it‚Äôs impossible to breathe. The ear loops seem to hold their stretch, even after several hours of use, and feel comfortable while on. Overall, these are a comfortable and attractive looking set of disposable masks to have on hand in these unusual times.",US,2020-12-06
5,"Good nose & facial coverage, pleating is nice, bendable nose wire & easy to breath through","These are nice disposable use face masks. The outer surface is smooth to the touch. These are also nice looking Vs the standard baby blue disposable ones. Depending on your use, environment & exposure you should be able to get more than one use per mask.

Each mask has elastic ear loops (non-adjustable) & a bendable nose wire to help you get a better seal over the bridge of your nose & across the tops of your cheeks & reduce fogging if you wear glasses (breathing through your nose also helps with this). I don't find these difficult to breath through.

Currently these are only 26 cents each (at the time of this review) which I believe is a good value for the fit & function of these disposable face masks.",US,2020-11-29
4,Pretty decent masks,"These days with masks being a necessity it seams like there‚Äôs a million different kinds and brands to choose from. I‚Äôve tried quite a few kinds of them now and I‚Äôm still searching for that perfect one that offers adequate protection but is still comfortable to wear and breath in.

These cool face masks are thicker than a lot of other ones I‚Äôve come across which is a good thing for protection, but it makes it a bit harder to breath. I didn‚Äôt have an issue with gaping on the sides which is a plus, and the ear hooks are decently comfortable as well. Overall these masks arnt a bad choice at all. Are they my holy grail mask? No. But are they better than most others and worth it?
Yes I think they are.",US,2020-12-01
5,"Very discrete, love the design","I have been using the blue paper face mask whenever I go out but I look like I just got out of a surgery. I started to look online to see if there were other options and saw the Viva Naturals Formal Designer Face Masks for Men (50 Pack) and thought I would give it a try.

I really like that the mask are almost similar to the standard light blue ones but they are actually an enhanced version of the standard ones. Not only the color is so much nicer, they also all have a metal nose strip for a better fit. I compared the quality of the Viva Naturals with my standard ones and it is very identical.

Overall, I am very satisfied with those disposable masks and they get a 5 stars from me.",US,2020-12-04
5,Premium mask,"Advertised as men's mask but it works for females too. I have a rather chubby face and this mask fits me very well. The mask strap is super stretchable and I was able to use a mask strap extender to make the fit even better. I wore it all day and the strap did not break or lose its strong elasticity. The mask itself is thick, comfortable and breathable. The fabric did not irritate my face at all. The print looks great, I've gotten compliments the first day I wore it. It passed both the water and fire test. It is one of the better disposable masks I've used so far, definitely top 5. Excellent price. Highly recommended.",US,2020-12-04
5,"Nice masks with a more subtle look - good for professional environments, too. Unisex.","I'm not sure why they are advertising these masks as solely for men, since they're pretty unisex - but they are much nicer looking than your standard baby blue ones. My whole family (all guys except for me) love these, and they're a nice go-to. There's something about the pattern that adds a nice statement and doesn't look so ""hospital"" or ""doctor-like"" when wearing them. I like that there's 50 per pack and they are reasonably comfortable to wear. I hate wearing masks, but at least these look a little less ridiculous and more subtle than many others out there. They get two thumbs up from us!",US,2020-12-13
5,Nice Fashionable Alternative,"Why not make the best out of covering our faces!? I like to have disposables but the plain looking ones are as fun as the reusable, this makes it nice to be able to have a fashionable disposable. I got these for my dad and husband, but I did try it on myself and they are a little big for me. I am a petite person, so I find some kids disposable mask fit me better. I definitely could make do with these it cover from right under my eye ti underneath my chin. Ear loops are perfect and feel like they could still stretch. The design kind of reminds me of a constellation.",US,2020-12-07
5,great quality and cool style,These masks are super cute. A great way to stay safe in a stylish way. These masks are soft and also comfortable. The mask material is gentle on skin and doesn't leave any marks or rashes on skin. The adjustable nose strip is very much flexible and allows to secure the mask snug over the nose. The ear loops has good stretch to it and works great and not irritating behind the ears. The masks seems to be made of very good quality. The packaging was also neat and arrived in good condition.,US,2020-12-07
5,Comfortable!,"I have 3 kids going to school every day and they must wear mask all day long. Comfort and quality are an absolute must! These mask actually fit me (5 ft3in woman) and my 12 year old son just right, they fit my 5 and 7 year old girls fine, I just tie a little knot in each ear loop. These are thicker yet breathable, they bend and stay in place at the nose. The material is comfortable and not at all itchy like other we have tried. I highly recommend these to any smaller sized adult or child.",US,2020-10-07
5,Full coverage.,"These fit great - the type that provide full coverage, and tuck themselves in on the side naturally so that you don't have a lot of air flowing in and out of the sides. They also have the nose piece to help hold them in place. They also seem a little thicker than most disposables.

Mine are blue with a slight design on them. I don't want to be fancy, but these have a pretty mild design and look good overall.

Overall, very good masks.",US,2020-12-04
3,Not comfortable and itches,"I have to say that these masks do protect you well and are of adequate thickness. I must say that they are NOT comfortable, especially around my ears - it hurts as the day progresses due to its tightness. Also, i have slight facial hair, so the mask degrades and very small things come out of it, and that itches my skin and nose very annoyingly (this literally happens within an hour of wear). I cannot continue to wear the mask. It looks nice though. Thanks.",US,2020-12-08
5,Best looking,"These are the best looking masks I've owned so far. It's hard to believe that these are disposable masks because they look so good. I like how these are still disposable and are three ply to keep away the viruses. There are no weird smell in the fit is pretty good. A typical problem with masks is the nose area having gaps. With this metal nose strip, I'm able to maintain a good seal and it doesn't fog up my glasses.",US,2020-12-20
5,Thick Masks,These masks feel thicker and higher quality than others that I've used. I recently watched an interview with a top doctor who advised wearing 3 layer surgical masks over cloth masks to better protect against infection and the spread of Covid 19. I feel much safer with these masks than I do with thin cotton cloth ones. I did the match test and this mask passed.,US,2020-12-02
5,Nice change of pace,"We have tons of washable masks, but honestly we just find the disposable easier. I like that these are a change of pace from the blue medical looking ones and hubby and I both wear a lot of navy blue. Comfortable as any of them have been. Has the nose clamp for a better fit. Fits me and my giant headed husband well.
I don't like that it's advertised as for men...",US,2020-12-03
4,Great,"I like these masks. They are much softer than the other disposable ones we have been using. They also fit both my husband and I fitting different face sizes. I am horrible with wearing a mask and washing it, so we like having these on hand to wear and toss. They also look better than the standard light blue ones.",US,2020-11-30
5,"Comfortable, Soft, No odors","These are soft, comfortable, and stay in place pretty well. My beard catches the bottom and pulls it down a little bit over time, but my girlfriend has no such problem. She can wear this for a few hours as a dance instructor and it helped with her glasses not fogging and stayed in place. Plus, they just look nice!",US,2020-12-05
4,Adorable,"The color of thee masks is a muted rose, not what is shown in the photograph. But they are still adorable.

I also like that these are bigger than many masks. It is sometimes hard to keep masks up when they are a little short. But these masks fit comfortably and stay in place.",US,2020-12-08
4,Nice basic masks,First the color displayed is much brighter than the actual product. It is still attractive but more understated. The masks are comfortable and the fit is about average overall. I personally prefer a bit more ear elastic but that is very much an individual taste.,US,2021-01-23
5,Just right for my dad,I really like the look of these masks. The dark blue color looks very nice! The design looks good! They are just right for my dad and looks so much better than the standard white facial masks. I like that they have layers of filtration as well.,US,2020-12-06
5,Nice,"Nice masks! Super comfy. Cute design too. Really good for an office or at home if you have someone come over without a mask. you can have these on hand for them to use, without looking too medical with regular white/blue masks.",US,2020-11-29
5,good looking and handy,"This 50 pack comes in smaller packs of 10 inside the box so we have stuck a pack of 10 inside each car and then in work bags and purses so we are never without a mask. They are good looking, too. No complaints.",US,2020-12-07
5,Nice Masks!,Hubby liked this mask and the fit was perfect for him. He is a smaller man so I do believe if a larger man tried these they might be a bit tight. Tim does have a beard and the mask encompasses this also on him.,US,2020-12-03
5,pretty in pink,These masks are well packed and labeled. The ear-loops hold well and the nose bridge holds its shape. My mother likes the pretty pink and they fit her face very well and comfortably.,US,2021-01-04
5,Great masks for kids,These fit both our 5 and 13 year old comfortably. They are definitely smaller than the adult masks. Great for right now since they have to wear them in schools.,US,2020-10-16
5,Good Masks,"These masks pass the ‚Äúcandle test‚Äù. These masks do not have a smell to them as I‚Äôve seen people comment on other masks on Amazon.
They have a nose wire as well. I will definitely be buying more.",Canada,2020-07-14
5,Good product,"These masks are great ,comfortable to wear. The fit is good, also have a metal wire for the nose. Bit of an oder when you first put them on seems to go away fast, but you'll notice it. Seem professionally made, or made to that standard. Elastics are excellent, the mask itself has plenty of size to cover nose, mouth and chin. There are three layers, easy to breath through though and light weight. These are well worth the dollar a piece I paid for them and they arrived quickly.",Canada,2020-07-06
5,Same as what was issued to me in the hospital,"These masks are absolutely identical to the ones which I was given in the hospital to use there. So I'm very satisfied and I used my first new one today at the hair dressing salon. I felt safe and so did my hair dresser who was wearing something similar. They are relatively comfortable and not too heavy or bulky. I can breath fairly well in it and we were sitting by an open window which helped. I go to very few places but I always wear a mask when out in public and at home if someone comes over like an electrician or plumber, both of whom we had in recently. Now I have a box of masks so I can give one to anyone coming in who doesn't have one. No excuses.",Canada,2020-09-01
5,canada no 1 quality mask,Second time buy this brand mask. high quality with resonable price. recommanded.,Canada,2020-06-30
4,Good but not the best.,"Good quality, I am sure it is a level one mask. Water can not go through the first color layer. I tried to burn the second layer and it is good meltdown nonwoven. The aluminum piece is the weak point. I will give 5 stars if it is a bit thicker and half inch longer.
The meltdown fabric in the middle layer can be hung on the palm because it is electrostatically charged and is able to capture very fine particle.",Canada,2020-07-18
5,Best mask I ever buy,"I have received these masks from THINKA and they are really really good. Few facts I want to share with:

1. Came in fast by Canadapost.
2. These are really good quality 3 layers masks. Earloops are thick enough, so it is really comfortable when you wear them. My pack didn't have a single broken ear loop. No masks crack during wearing.
3. Masks arrived well packed in a box and were sealed in a transparent packaging.
4. All my family members are happy with the mask.

Highly recommended!",Canada,2020-07-09
5,Good quality masks but for smaller features,"These masks arrived very quickly, I wasn't sure which ones to choose, but these have good ratings so I ordered them, They have a very good fit and covers my face as well as my chin nicely, I also like that you can adjust the nose to properly fit, But the only thing is that they Hurt my ears and I have small features and average ears, I couldn't see someone who has larger features wear it comfortably since I had sore ears when the afternoon was over ( I wore them for about 4 hours) So I'd say they have a very snug fit but are meant for smaller faces",Canada,2020-07-23
5,Good quality face masks!,some face masks I have bought before didn‚Äôt even have a sealed plastic wrap on the masks. This one for sure can ensure you that masks are not contaminated on the transportation. Highly recommend it!,Canada,2020-06-28
5,Best fit and comfort so far,"These seem to be the best fitting masks that i've tried, meaning i'm not constantly adjusting for comfort.

Thanks!",Canada,2020-07-13
1,The elastic breaks right away.,I really wanted to like those masks because the price was good and I need several masks every day for my work. From the first 18 masks only 6 didn‚Äôt break. 5 of them the elastic broke right away seconds after I took out of the box and 1 broke few minutes into a treatment (I had to leave the room and the patient to put another mask on). That is very dangerous when a mask breaks while I‚Äôm treating patients. I simply can‚Äôt use those masks for work at all.,Canada,2020-10-14
4,I'm a retired nurse so I have some experience with masks. These are the best I have found so far.,"I have 200 of these masks now. I bought one box and ordered 7 more when I found they were well made and comfortable over the ears. I am very fussy with elastic over the ears and can't tolerate a mask if the ear pieces are too tight or made of uncomfortable material. They fit well around my average sized face, and not too bad of a fit on my large nosed husband. lol We stocked up as the covid stats are rising in our area, and we may need to give masks to our neighbours and health care workers if things keep getting worse. I feel good about recommending them.",Canada,2020-08-25
5,The Best Disposable Masks Available,"My wife has asthma and bronchitis and she is required to wear a mask for 40 hours per week at work. She found the cloth masks were far too thick and restrictive when it came to her breathing, she we purchased a box of these. These masks are absolutely fantastic. They are very breathable, durable and comfortable for long periods. Excellent for anyone with breathing difficulties that is required to wear a mask for extended periods of time.

The ear straps are strong and hold the mask in place. There is a thin wire around the nose area that can be bent and shaped to fix snug around the nose. Overall fantastic value, and would strongly recommend.",Canada,2020-08-06
1,Value for money - feels flimsy,"For the price I paid, its value for money. That said, the material feels flimsy. The ear loops were a bit too long for this Asian of middle height.

The fit on the face was fine, and the seal was effective.

Update 1 day later. Strap broke off from the mask, as I was tying a knot. FAIL!",Canada,2020-09-06
1,These were poor quality and small. False advertising.,"The masks were ridiculous small in size. Too small to be of any
Benefit. Fake advertising. They offered me a $5.00 credit on my account but that
Never happened. Crap. Do not buy.",Canada,2020-09-04
1,"Don't buy: poorly packaged, nose pins botched, uncomfortable","As I mentioned in the title, the box was poorly packaged, some of the masks got their nose pin botched, all the masks are packed in one poly, not comfortable at all. I can go on, but I think I have made the point already.",Canada,2020-08-13
5,Real stuff; Low package.,"Masks are surprisingly good, real stuff, so I immediately put another order after received the first box;

But like some of the other reviews, the outside package came opened and broken, doesn‚Äôt look trustworthy at all and make the product quality feel compromised...",Canada,2020-08-03
5,High Quality Masks,"These masks are by far the best I have tried to date. They seem to be very high quality, for example the ear loops are quite strong and the elastic holds up even after wearing them for a while. The nose piece conforms well to my face which helps make sure air doesn‚Äôt escape out the top. From what I can see, they do seem to actually be registered with Health Canada, which I am happy about.

I will say that they are quite large, and too large for my face wearing them normally. But this is the same for all masks I have tried so far, and by twisting the ear loops (or using a mask ear strap hook that goes behind your head) I manage to get a good fit.",Canada,2020-09-19
5,"Quality masks, good value",I‚Äôm really impressed with the quality of these mask‚Äôs they are made really well. They were an excellent deal so I ended up getting 2 boxes. They are easy to breath in and the straps don‚Äôt hurt my ears like other masks do. The fit is also great the contour around the nose with a metal strip and they go down under your chin. I bought some similar masks at a local retailer and the price was more and the quality wasn‚Äôt as good. Would definitely recommend to anyone that‚Äôs looking for masks.,Canada,2020-09-17
4,basic masks with a good value,"i bought masks a few times from different places in a 50 pack like this and they all look about the same. those are not different. even if it says procedure masks , i did not see the difference with other masks that are said to be non medical masks and that came from china. for the price they are good basic masks but maybe not the best protection. if you look for high protection better look elsewhere. the packaging is not very good. the box dont hold well together.",Canada,2020-08-13

4,ASTM L1 Approved Mask,"It's ASTM L1 Approved Mask, this is what I buying for.
Though some post saying it's not, but at least this one is marking with thus and with a lab test cert picture on the page and it's fulfilled by Amazon.... all these make me more confident than all other brands with unknown sellers from nowhere...
And the price is decent.

5,Great masks during these COVID times,"I wear glasses and I always found the cotton masks never fit snug enough to my nose to prevent my glasses from becoming foggy. Then I bought these masks and the nose piece can be pressed tightly enough to the bridge of your nose that it prevents your hot air from escaping and fogging up your glasses. I also have found the ear loops are just tight enough to stay fitted, but not too tight to make them uncomfortable. I have bought 4 boxes so far and each time they were on sale. Highly recommend!",Canada,2021-01-12
1,Why are two boxes different?,"I ordered two boxes. The boxes are different, but more important is that masks inside are different too. I am confused and not feel comfort about it. One box is genuine, another is fake?",Canada,2020-09-28
1,Pas satisfait,"Apr√®s juste 01 heure d'utilisation, le masque devient inconfortable √† cause des poils qui se d√©tachent √† l'int√©rieur du masque et qui chatouillent le nez. Tr√®s inconfortable... on est oblig√© de changer plusieurs fois de masque par jour alors qu'on peut porter certains maques semblables pendant plusieurs jours.
En plus, les √©lastiques ne sont pas r√©sistantes, ils se d√©tachent facilement.
Je ne recommande pas ce masque.",Canada,2020-09-24
5,Best Procedure level 1 mask so far I come across,"I have had many different types of level 1 mask that I have tried during this pandemic, and I would say this mask I ordered so far fits the bill as best one. The other masks that resemble this either were poor quality (the loops broke or the nose piece was very small or not even on the mask) or had a smell while wearing. These masks fit nice, the material is good tough construction, the ear loops are very sturdy and most important they stretch! I can wear this for many hours with comfort. I have ordered a 2nd box to stock up!",Canada,2020-09-16
5,"High quality, no-odor, 3-layer mask at a very reasonable price","Compared to other masks, I appreciate that there was no discernable odor to the new masks, that there was an aluminum band to fit the mask properly around my nose, and that it fit well to my face (adult sizing). The band was attached well, and the package just happens to fit perfectly in the centre console of my car. Latest Health Canada recommendations suggest that a 3-layer mask non-surgical mask is recommended: this mask meets those requirements. The mask is also latex-free so it prevents irritation from those who have latex sensitivity.",Canada,2020-11-04
5,Appear to be decent quality protection at an excellent price.,"Considering we are close to another lockdown situation here in Montreal, and even though I have a few high quality reusable masks, when I saw these at this price point I would have been foolish not to pick up a box. This way I will always have a clean mask at the ready or a mask available for any friend who may need one. I can easily see prices doubling or more in weeks to come or becoming difficult to find as people begin to hoard again, and it was not worth the risk of getting stuck without.

I have not worn one for any length of time yet, but they seem to be close to what I was given to wear when I was in the hospital for surgery this week. A quick fitting test found the mask to be comfortable and easy to breathe through while passing the quick candle blow out test. Provides complete coverage and the nose piece is easy to adjust and holds its shape well. I will be bringing a couple with me tomorrow when I have a followup appointment and ask my doctor for his opinion as well and will edit this post accordingly if he believes them to be inadequate.

My only complaint is that they all came packaged together whereas I would have much preferred them to be in multiple packages of quantities of 5 or 10. Having to open the entire bag when I need one mask, allowing the entire package to possibly become contaminated is not my preferred way of having them. So the first thing I did was repackage them in packs of 5 masks with my FoodSaver vacuum sealer. I now have 8 packs of 5, sealed from possible contaminants and have kept 10 in the original bag to use as required.

Tomorrow, after I return home, I will do a dissection of the mask I wore and compare it to one from the hospital and edit my review to include any details that are pertinent.",Canada,2020-12-06
3,Okay if you're in a pinch,"As a healthcare provider, I wouldn't choose to use these disposable masks during a clinic because they feel cheap compared to masks the health authority purchases and they have a definite chemical smell. However: for the purposes of using a disposable mask when going into a personal appointment or the grocery store, these certainly work well.
The packaging came damaged and the masks aren't easy to pull out of the box, but the ear straps are long enough that I don't get an ear ache while wearing them.
I'll probably try to find a higher quality disposable mask set next time.",Canada,2020-11-29
1,Very poor quality loops on this brand of mask,Very poor quality masks compared to other disposable masks that I have used. We have used about 15 masks so far and at least one ear loop will always break either while putting on or with the slightest adjustment. Not recommended at all. Wish I could get a refund,Canada,2020-09-09
4,"Great Masks, Great Price","Just received the facial masks, didn't take long, great packaging!
Pros: Comfortable (could only give it a 4 on this simply because masks aren't as comfortable as free face, lol. No odor, Easy to breathe, Absolutely love the non-latex ear loops! Great for anyone allergic to latex. Definitely a good buy, at this low price!
Cons: Minor.....l, like a large number of women, have a small face so l have to tie the ends of the ear loops to have the mask fit good.",Canada,2020-07-27
2,Uncomfortable,"After 15 minutes the fibers inside the mask come loose and cause your nose and lips to itch. Therefore you rub your mask to relieve the itching, only to cause more fibers to dislodge and worsen things. Would not recommend.",Canada,2020-10-04
5,Good medical-grade mask which is comfortable and breathable for daily wear,"These are great. I wear one in the morning at work, and swap out to a new one half way through my shift (just for my own peace of mind) for the days I forget to bring my cloth masks. Seeing how I wear these all day at work, I find they're fairly comfortable (for a mask, anyway) and I feel they do a good job. They have an adjustable nose piece so the mask doesn't move around as much. I'm on my second box now and so far no issues, would recommend these if you were wanting a better, and actual MEDICAL grade, mask.",Canada,2020-12-23
4,Decent for the price but too big and not great for breathing.,"I bought these due to a recent hospital visit where the mask they gave me fit like a charm, was light as a feather and I could breathe much more easily than my 3-ply cotton masks. These Thinka masks looked just like the hospital masks but they are big with loose ear strings. They ride up my face and interfere with my eyes. The breathability is not nearly as good as the hospital ones. However, considering the price, these are more comfortable than the cotton ones I was wearing and an improvement so I'm happy for now.",Canada,2021-01-11
3,Pretty good,"These masks work well for casual use - they are comfortable. Decent for the price point. Only complaint is that they do have a bad smell when you put it on the first couple of times. However, the smell does go away after a while of use.",Canada,2020-08-10
2,Better packaging but product quality is not good!,I should have given 1 star after using it few days! Please note that it is not made in Canada it come from China. I am giving it 2 star because they atleast post a picture of the product where it says made in China! If you use the mask for short time like 30 minutes to 1 hour then go for it.,Canada,2020-12-12
4,Good product that at least alleges ASTM level 1 compliance,"These fit better than a brand of ‚Äònon-medical‚Äô masks, better seal around the mouth and nose. The outer cover does not allow water through the mask. The ear straps are a good length and the long aluminum nose band allows the top of the mask to be shaped to nose and upper face. I had no problems with my glasses fogging. It is a 3 layer mask with a layer of melt blown fabric in the middle. Comfortable to wear, slight medicinal smell that dissipates quickly. The box reports made in China, and claims >= 95% particulate filter efficiency. These do look like genuine medical procedure masks. Shipping was within days.",Canada,2021-01-31
2,Tolerable...,"These masks arrived neatly packaged, in a plastic bag. Odd but there was a couple of dead insects (tiny flys) in between some of the creases of the mask. Ewww...some masks looked dirty. I really inspected them before I wore them. Those that looked dirty I threw out (so far 5 masks I tossed). They have a bit of an odd smell, not sure if it is a disinfectant, but its mild but definitely there. I am wearing these masks, reluctantly but still wearing them. If I don't keel over from covid let's hope I don't keel over from whatever has been sprayed on them. Wouldn't buy again.",Canada,2020-11-18
4,Squeeze My Eyes Shut,"These do the job and are fine quality wise, but if I wear them and do anything other than sit still, the top slides up and starts pushing my eyes shut from the bottom. It was fine for a haircut where I just sat in a chair, but when I tried to wear it on the walk home I couldn't. That said, I have a relatively small head, and my husband's is more average-sized. The masks seem to work fine for him.",Canada,2020-08-27
5,This mask helps me from allergy symptoms,"I am allergic to cat dander. However, for some reasons, l have a cat at home right now.

This mask is real BFE95, now l can pet the cat when l am wearing this mask. Great product.",Canada,2020-07-31
5,Best disposable masks you can buy on Amazon,"I've bought many masks on Amazon as well as in supermarkets, and can confirm this mask is the best you can buy. It passes the candle test, the water test, and the flame burn test. Packaging is neat and tidy and the nose clip is high quality and stays tighter than other ones. I'm actually ordering more. Not a scam.",Canada,2020-08-30
4,Comfortable with high breathability but...,"These masks are comfortable with high breathability. I wore them outside in 34 degrees with no issues in breathing. They have good nose bridge/strip that sticks to your face.

However, one con about these masks is that your eye glasses fog really quickly. So I hope the manufacturer takes this into consideration next time.

Also, I am not sure how legitimate the certificate is that shows these are surgical masks.",Canada,2020-07-20
5,Good Masks,"Good Masks to have around in the current COVID-19 world. Passes the ""flame test"", so at least it will afford you and those around you some protection.

Packaging is Ok, the masks were sealed in shrink wrap.

Good value for the money, these shipped quickly, unlike so many other vendors trying to make a quick buck during a pandemic, these were sold at a fair pricem and were actually received.",Canada,2020-09-05
4,Good quality masks,"These are good quality masks. The masks are not flimsy and the thickness is pretty good. The aluminum nose wire is excellent! However I wish they covered more of the sides of my cheeks. I have an average size face and I find these masks a little narrow. The real surgical masks in the hospitals are larger and they protect the sides on the cheeks as well, leaving less air flow. I plan on using these but next time I'll be looking for wider masks. If you're uncomfortable with a narrow mask you can always double up with a cotton mask.",Canada,2020-10-03
4,Second time I buy,"I bought these masks twice. They fit well are large enough to cover mouth and nose evenly. The strap is durable and the small metal strip can be adjusted around the nose. On some masks the metal strip is damaged, broken or a little bit too much on one side. I had three or four masks that were flawed.

The price is way better now. First time I bought they were 27 Dollar second time just 17 Dollar.

If you can get your hands on FFP2 and KN95 masks buy those instead. I haven't found any to a reasonable price thus I bought these ones.",Canada,2020-11-24
3,Inconsequent Quality,"While there are still some to go in the box, I have so far encountered several where the elastic has separated from the mask when putting it on, and a few that do not have the wire that helps fit it over the nose, both problems rendering the mask useless. Most in the box are fine, but it should be ALL of them in the box. When going out, bring one or two spares just in case.",Canada,2021-01-08
3,Good quality but not suitable for a smaller head/face,"Lots of pros but one major con which is a problem. Pros: Good quality masks and packaged in a sanitary way (sealed bag inside the box). Masks also have a comfortable and flexible nose piece.
Major con: Ear loops don't fit smaller heads. Ear loops are too loose, mask does not fit snugly enough and therefore is not very effective. I either have to double the earloops (awkward and not comfortable for long) or put a washable mask over the mask to create a good seal. Too bad because otherwise the mask is good. I won't be repurchasing this product.",Canada,2020-12-21
1,Garbage Product,"Mask is extremely small, almost child sized.

Material, glue, whatever it's made out of is very cheap and feels like you're wearing an old wool army blanket on your face. It constantly scratches and itches. Extremely not recommended for people with sensitive skin.

Hard plastic pieces/glue constantly pokes into the skin.

Over all a very cheap made product that is intolerable for wearing after 10-15 minutes. Do not buy.",Canada,2020-12-14
2,Good mask but defective earloop,The mask are good but they have a major problem that make them useless. Almost half of the box have defective earloop and they can detach at any moment so if you dont have backup on you its can be problematic.,Canada,2020-10-18
4,Would buy again,"Box came crushed but the masks are sealed inside plastic so they were fine. Quality was expected and fine. Over priced but that is to be expected during the pandemic.

Only bought to have a back up in the car in case we ever forget our cloth ones or need to give to someone. I hate the idea of disposable but it's necessary at times I guess.",Canada,2020-11-06
5,Good Enough,"These masks have a good fit and feel like they are probably working well. The nose pinch is more effective than the masks I can get at other stores. When you first get them, open the pack and let the stack of masks offgass to remove the manufacturer smell, but it does not smell that seriously. My goal was a balance of quantity and quality and these are good enough for the price.",Canada,2021-01-24
1,IT IS NOT A PROCEDURE MASK !!!!!!,"LOOSE FIT....WILL NOT STOP ANY THING FROM ENTERING YOUR SYSTEM
EXACLY SAME AS THE OTHER ONES FOUND IN SUPERMARKETS M LOOSE FIT, GAPING SPACES ON SIDES OF FACE!!! UNLESS YOU HAVE A BIG FACE I GUESS / ARE A MALE ...MAYBE",Canada,2020-11-08
1,Poor quality.,Strings break on 50% of masks before you can even put the on.,Canada,2020-09-04
4,Decent fit,Much better for fit than the Costco ones I was using. It does seem thin compared to procedure masks I was using as a dental hygienist. I‚Äôve only worn one so don‚Äôt have the best idea of the durability of the ear loops but no problems yet. Liked that the masks inside were in plastic so as not to get contaminated during shipping.,Canada,2020-12-03
1,Box has no seal,"They look identical to the ones from the hardware store for 4.99/50pc. The only ""proof"" is a small label inside the not sealed plastic bag, similar to those cheap ones, but in English. It's in a nice shiny box though. The box might make up for the extra 15$, and the sentence: Health Canada Medical Device Establishment License. License Number: 12163
But as long as the box and the bag have no seal, it could be anything. Therefore, only 1 star.",Canada,2021-01-27
5,Comfortable for people with glasses too,Comfortable and easy to stretch. I feel safe wearing them because it covers my face properly and doesn‚Äôt move. The nose part can be shaped on the nose in a way where it doesn‚Äôt move at all. I wear glasses so the nose shaping helps me since fog from my breath gets in the way easily when I wear masks. This masks was good for me because the nose part of the mask is easily shaped around the nose.,Canada,2021-01-07
5,üëç,"Packaged in a sealed bag and easy to dispense from the box one at a time. Bendable wire at the nose makes it easy to shape and with a gentle pull outward on the mask at the chin, it is easy to position the folds in the mask into a position that feels secure. This mask is an easy one to wear. You can even double up and wear two and still wear this one without discomfort.",Canada,2020-12-21
1,Too thin,A little too thin. Poor quality than I expected.,Canada,2020-09-03
1,Elastics not securely attached to mask,Was the glue factory on strike? Every other mask had elastics that snapped off the mask the moment they were stretched. Two expensive boxes and less than a third were useable. Not good value for money.,Canada,2020-10-07
1,"GARBAGE, NOT SAFE, DON‚ÄôT BUY!!","Omg please DO NOT buy these, they‚Äôre super thin and they offer absolutely zero protection, I tried the first one on and blew a lighter out instantly, as a nurse I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these to anyone, they offer about as much protection as using a pair of nylons over your face. I am returning the 2 boxes I have, very disappointed and disgusted they would even allow the sales of such a flimsy piece of garbage during an already very scary pandemic!!",Canada,2020-12-01
5,Ordered for my parents for weekly hospital visits,"Purchased for my parents. They had some reusable masks before, but my father recently became ill and is required to visit the hospital every week now. For hospital visits, they use disposable masks, as when they go in, the hospital gives them a different mask to use rather than the one they go in with.",Canada,2021-01-15
5,Very satisfied with these high-quality masks!,"I'm very satisfied. The masks are thick enough (I feel protected like this), comfortable (I can breathe and the mask is not hurting my face and/or ears), solid (the aluminum strip holds very well and the body of the mask seems to be rigid enough), not expensive and well packaged (the 50 masks are in a transparent plastic pouch). The box has a big hole where you can take the masks one by one. You can also close the box cover if you don't want the masks to be exposed to the air. That's well designed! I already purchased 2 boxes for my family, then another 2 boxes as a birthday gift for my brother. I'll definitely buy more if I'm running out of medical masks. And if the factory wants to make the whole thing even better, I'd suggest replacing the transparent plastic pouch with a transparent zip bag instead. Although the plastic pouch is resealable, it is very thin and doesn't look that durable. If the masks are in a zip bag, then I can choose whether to put the masks directly in the box after removing the zip bag or just to leave everything in the zip bag as is. I personally prefer leaving masks in their original packaging so I won't have to touch the masks for hygiene purposes. Since my family just wears masks when we go to public places, we don't need them every day. It's not the same as in hospitals or clinics where a lot of people need to wear masks all the time. In the latter context, putting the masks in the box would make sense because it's easier to take them one by one. Anyways, I'm already very happy with my purchases. I've also recommended theses masks to friends. Thank you very much for selling high-quality masks! :)",Canada,2020-09-24
5,Excellent price/performance ratio,"We found these to be very good overall. Excellent fit, good quality metal strip allowing to 'seal' around the nose and comfortable to wear. They are a bit thinner than the medical 3M masks but on the other side more comfortable to wear for longer periods. Recommended.",Canada,2020-09-20
1,Reduced material make it uncomfortable,"What a poor quality control that every mask in the two boxes that I purchased has a reduced, asymmetric sealing stripe! When I wear this mask the right side is always leaking. The right side of my glasses is always blurring in the winter, which makes me half-blinded!",Canada,2020-12-06
5,Fits Well,"These masks fit really well on an adult. There is enough ""stretch"" that they cover the width and length of my face correctly. It is not bulky, and I find it just as easy to breathe as I do the cloth masks. It doesn't ride up very much so I don't constantly have to pull it down. Excellent value.",Canada,2020-12-03
1,Poor quality.,"Very poor quality.
The elastics break as they are not properly attached.
Do not buy.",Canada,2020-09-26
5,High Standards,Much better than what is offered at London Drugs or Costco. (Bought from both & not the same medical specs or quality at all) If you do your research on Eurofin (who tested them) & the ASTM international standards that they meet - THESE ARE GOOD. Level 1 ASTM medical masks but with the filtration level of the higher Level 3 mask.,Canada,2020-09-02
4,Can I confirm if the products are exactly the same as advertised?,"The product doesn't have the same certificate as shown from other customers' review. My packages received today, the Chinese/English certificate didn't not show the manufacturing date and inspection/batch number as what I saw from previous reviews by other customer . I ordered Thinka as I saw many positive comments and there is a Certificate in the package. However, what I have got seems the exactly the same. Not sure if they are second batch.
The nose wire is not as long as I expected. I will give 7 out of 10",Canada,2020-07-29
5,Good masks,"Bought these for school.
Thick metal nose clip that holds its shape (not a plain metal wire like you see in many other masks), comfortable enough to wear for 8 hours (recommended to change every 4 hours), can't blow a candle no matter how hard I try with one of these on, so that's much better than a reusable face mask (which are not allowed in school anyway).

Overall satisfied.",Canada,2021-01-08
5,colle bien au visage,"Ce masque est de bonne conception, le tissu est de grande qualit√©. Il colle tr√®s bien au visage, c'est tr√®s facile de respirer pendant plusieurs heures. Je me sens vraiment bien prot√©g√© et les boucles sont parfaite pas trop serr√©es aux oreilles. Je suis enti√®rement satisfaite de mon achat.",Canada,2020-08-10
5,The masks fit.,"The masks fit okay and the loops are comfortable enough. We wear them when we go shopping or to other places where lots of people congregate.
The box they came in was a little squished, but we were able to straighten the cardboard walls. (Not a big problem). The price was right. I recommend these masks and the seller. Delivery was on time.",Canada,2020-09-06
5,A mask that provides comfort & security!,"I highly recommend this product!
Of all the disposable masks, I have used, I must say that these masks offer the most comfortable fit. The metal piece above the nose easily, comfortably and securely shapes & holds the mask in place. So far, they are the thickest masks I have ever worn. I feel more confidently protected when wearing a THINKA PROCEDURE MASK.

Thank you! :)",Canada,2021-01-22
4,It's well made,Arrived on time and the masks look strong and well made. Packaging looks exactly the same as in the pics. It's a good product but it's a little small and the ear loops are a bit tight. Overall I think it's worth buying if you have a relatively small face.,Canada,2020-07-14
5,These are medical masks.,The mask itself is very comfortable the flexible metal strip fits around the bridge of the nose very well making a good seal. As with most masks what I find difficult is that when you open your mouth wide the masks have a tendency to slip below your nose .The mask otherwise is a very good product economical to purchase and does provide a barrier.,Canada,2020-11-23
5,So much better than the fabric masks....,"These are excellent masks. The same ones I was given to the hospital while having a surgic procedure. I will try to keep wearing my fabric made masks for environmental reason for short trips to the market but these ones here are much better for longer uses, like travels, classrooms and so.",Canada,2020-09-19
5,"Comfortable, no odor, and great quality. Highly recommended!","I was initially skeptical when ordering, but pleasantly surprised at the quality upon receiving. Elastic bands and a fit so comfortable I couldn't really feel the mask at all (adult male). No noticeable odor. Would order again without hesitation from same vendor.",Canada,2020-10-13
5,Good Quality!,"Unexpected fast delivery!!!!made the order today and get the product the other day!!! Super high quality and It was well packed.
Highly recommend!!! I bought a lot of masks from different places. I am super confident this is the best I‚Äôve ever used!!!! Highly recommend!!!!",Canada,2020-07-21
1,It‚Äôs not worth wasting money on it,It‚Äôs fake don‚Äôt bother wasting your money. Not surprised tho with the price,Canada,2020-09-05
1,smell so bad they are unuseable,the masks have a terrible smell that just does not go away even if you air them out. They are impossible to wear.,Canada,2020-11-06
5,They pass the flame/candle test,"These masks are great and they actually work and seal properly. I've bought other disposable one time use ""non medical"" masks from canadian tire and they were awful compared to these. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to buy them for everyday use!",Canada,2020-09-30
5,Great satisfaction,I like these mask because it‚Äôs made with thick material as well as these r medical grade mask. Feel my self safe Nd protected whenever commuting. Felt safe for my kids in school in person learning. My trust build up with these for it‚Äôs grate material.üëçüëç,Canada,2021-01-02
4,Made in China.,No longer sure if these are real surgical masks. Quality issues and inconsistent packaging in recent batch...and why do ALL their products have the same LOT number??? ü§î,Canada,2020-10-09
5,Soft and comfortable,I like that these masks are soft like the medical masks...these might even be identical. Some of the ones you find in stores or even Costco are very rigid on the nose. These fit snug to the nose...also alleviating the foggy glasses problem we were having.,Canada,2020-09-06
5,Fits well. Does what its suppose to do.,"I am by no means an expert when it comes to these masks. The fit on my face is quite well. Does have a tiny metal strip at the top so a pinch makes it conform to my nose. I did a candle test and it passed without issue. Doesn't have any chemical smell to it.

Overall satisfied with the purchase.",Canada,2020-11-05
5,Great masks to wear and fit well,"Perfect masks to wear. At $19.99 they are now pricey as you can get boxes of 50 for $10 and less. But if you need some in a pinch, these work great. They have the metal strip, not that weak plastic one for the nose, and not much else to say!",Canada,2020-12-24
3,Medical use?,"I bought it because it says it's medical use, so I expect it to be more comfortable and wellmade. However, I found it has no better than the one that I bought in store.",Canada,2020-11-03
3,The earloops are too lose for me,"The earloops of the mask are too lose for me. Besides, I bought this mask because it is on sale. However, after receiving this mask, the prices dropped even more.",Canada,2020-11-02
5,Will buy again,"I'm pregnant and am not taking any chances with the new variants. If I absolutely need to go out, I am now wearing this surgical mask with a 3-4 layered cloth mask on top. I am happy with the quality, fit and nosewire and will order again.",Canada,2021-01-29
2,Disappointed,I'm disappointed that they're made in china. Not happy about that. I should have looked more closely or asked before buying. And in comparison to ones from the hospital these are not at all like that quality. I hoped they would be similar. Instead they are sadly more like the dollar store ones and not as comfortable.,Canada,2020-10-15
5,Impeccable,"Ma crainte avec les masques jetables est la fr√©quente mauvaise qualit√© des √©lastiques qui d√©collent et se d√©tachent trop souvent. Dans ce cas-ci, rien √† redire jusqu'ici. J'en ai utilis√© 5 ou 6 jusqu'√† maintenant. Aucun √©lastique d√©coll√©, le pince-nez tient bien le masque en place et emp√™che la formation de bu√©e dans les lunettes. Je suis tr√®s satisfait de mon achat.",Canada,2021-02-03
3,This ASTM L1 mask feel flimsy,"I chose to buy this box of mask is because it said it is an ATSM L1 mask. However, I can wear it and blow off the candle....The mask feel so thin, when I put it on, the size is bigger than other standard mask. I was thinking to use this mask for doctor appointment visit, guess I have to find another mask, but as a normal daily use, i think it is ok, but if that is my purchase purpose, I will not pay this price for this quality. overall, it is an acceptable mask for daily use, but I don't feel safe to use it at higher risk places.",Canada,2021-01-06
5,Medical Mask <3,"Thank you so much for the opportunity to purchase these masks in our time of need, they are approved Medical Masks with the needed safety, the ear loops are comfortable and others plus me feel safe-respectful for keeping the vulnerable healthy and safe... :)",Canada,2020-09-22
5,An extra protection under my cloth mask,I bought these masks to put under my cloth masks. Very comfortable. And this is what the scientists suggest to fight the new mutation.,Canada,2021-02-02
5,Bien fait et surtout tige de m√©tal bien solide.,"Tr√®s satisfait de ces masques, comme je porte des lunettes, la tige de m√©tal est faite solide, et emp√™che la formation de bu√©e dans mes lunettes, avec l'hiver qui arrive, c'est un gros plus. On respire bien dans ces masques, ils ont une r√©sistance acceptable. J'ai essay√© d'autre masque a plus bas prix, mais la bande du nez n'√©tait pas assez solide, j'avais trop de bu√©e dans mes lunettes. Ceux ci, sont les meilleurs que j'ai trouv√© avec un co√ªt acceptable.",Canada,2020-11-04
5,My Goto Mask during Covid,"This is a very comfortable mask. I forget that I have it on after a while. Once you set it properly, there don't seem to be any air gaps. This is not a child-size mask like so many that were selling around this price, this fits very well. Would highly recommend.",Canada,2020-10-09
5,Good quality Mask,"Good quality mask, made in China but I found it is thicker than other we can buy from Amazon/retail store. Nose clip is made by wire, not plastic which add comfort and also can secure, adjust the mask on the nose easier. I am satisfied with this purchase",Canada,2020-08-26
4,Appear to be good quality and nice fit,"Down side is these were less expensive locally. arrived 4 days earlier then posted and left outside on step.
Costco is selling similar masks for $5 for 50. I don't see any difference. Amazon getting non competitive on some items",Canada,2020-11-30
4,odd odour,"There is an odour , not offensive , just unexpected when first donned .. They also are quite well fitting ,but have have several straps break off when donning and or taking off .. defiantly not a multi use item..",Canada,2020-12-10
4,Little over priced,"Probably a little over priced for the quality of them but they were in stock and available so what can you do right now??

Hopefully the straps stay on these better than the other ones I have bought.",Canada,2020-10-03
5,Professional Quality Masks,"Good quality masks, exactly the same as you‚Äôd receive when visiting a medical facility. The box is also a dispenser but the cardboard is quite thin so it didn‚Äôt survive shipment but the masks themselves are excellent.",Canada,2021-01-31
2,Produit mal assembl√©,"Il y a 5/6 masques par boite de 50 unit√©s qui sont d√©fectueux . La bande √©lastique se d√©fait du masque
toujours au m√™me endroit(voir photo) . √áa repr√©sente un taux de d√©fectueux de plus de 10% alors je ne peux pas recommander ce produit.",Canada,2020-11-12
5,Best Combination of protection and price,"These masks offer much better protection than the standard masks on the market, as this is rated as a ASTM Level 1 mask - do some research on the different face mask types, when you buy anything less than a Level 1 mask, you aren't really protecting yourself. For the small difference in price, buy these Level 1 masks instead. They offer much better protection for yourself, as well as other people around you. I find these masks very comfortable and they have a good fit.",Canada,2020-12-12
4,Better than some competitors,Nose piece feels better than others. So far haven't had a strap pull off the mask which is also good. Multiple masks get pulled out at once.,Canada,2020-09-10
1,Poor quality.,Very poor quality mask.,Canada,2020-09-27
5,So good,"The Masks arrived as scheduled. Product is acceptable.
The fit is good, also have a metal wire for the nose. Bit of an oder when you first put them on seems to go away fast, but you'll notice it. Seem professionally made, or made to that standard. Elastics are excellent, the mask itself has plenty of size to cover nose, mouth and chin. There are three layers, easy to breath through though and light weight. These are well worth the dollar a piece I paid for them and they arrived quickly.",Canada,2020-07-23
5,Les meilleurs trouver,Nous les utilisons pour conduire et il vont tr√®s bien parce que il moule bien la forme du nez de fa√ßon √† ne pas laisser passer la chaleur de la respiration pour bu√©e les lunettes nous en avons essayer plusieurs marque et les lunettes buait toujours c‚Äôest un inconv√©nient en hiver c‚Äôest pour cela que nous avons adopt√© ce mod√®le.,Canada,2021-01-20
4,Good quality slightly big,These are good masks my only issue is the ear loops are large and not adjustable so it leaves a bit of a lip on the sides that don't make it feel as secure as Id like. But everything is else is good,Canada,2021-01-10
1,Nose piece is off,"The nose piece is skewed towards the left of your face and doesn't span the full width of the mask. Because of this, mask looks and feels weird (who would actually put the aluminum strip on the exterior of the mask?!), as if only half your face is covered. Bought two boxes and it was already too late when I started going through the first box. Both boxes have this issue. Don't buy from them until they acknowledge and fix this issue in newer batches.",Canada,2020-12-29
4,I like this nose piece,"The nose piece in these is better than most. It‚Äôs a bit longer and more flexible so that it‚Äôs easier to get a good seal. I have never understood why so many masks have such crap nosepieces, I get the shortages of mask materials but I didn‚Äôt realize there was a shortage of aluminum! Hopefully the quality is actually as advertised, I have no way to test that!",Canada,2020-10-19
5,Great masks!!!,"These masks are great. For my needs, these fit the bill. They are comfortable, easy to put on and love their disposable feature. I always have a new mask on hand in the car whenever I go out. Love them.",Canada,2020-11-07
1,Bad quality of the product.,Bad quality of the product. The straps to support the face suddenly are breaking.,Canada,2020-09-10
5,"Unprecedented comfort, stability and quality","Very comfortable to wear. Far more than you would expect, trust me. Doesn‚Äôt give off a weird chemical smell like many do. The flexibility of the nose strip and how it seals around your nose and upper cheek is perfect and super secure. No issues with the mask ever falling down your face a little bit, even while talking for long periods of time. Overall a superb value for your money.",Canada,2021-01-29
5,Nous recommandons!,"Tr√®s bien fabriqu√©s, ils tiennent en place. Ils ne font pas de ¬´ mousse ¬ª √† l‚Äôint√©rieur. On respire tr√®s bien. Le renfort en m√©tal pour la tenue sur le nez est en aluminium donc il garde la pose plusieurs heures!",Canada,2020-10-08
4,Legit,"Little bit of a baggy chin, totally useable though... My face is average size and I find it creeping into my eyes while maintaining a baggy chin. I wouldn't recommend for people with smaller than average faces",Canada,2020-10-06
4,THINKA PROCEDURE MASK WITH EARLOOPS,These do the job better than cloth masks - did the water test and none came through the Thinka but it did leak through my 3 layer cloth mask - not scientific of course but useful to know,Canada,2020-12-11
3,Just an average Procedural mask,"I found the masks to be just an average Procedural mask. Two issues I don't like: First, the ear loops are too loose for me. Second, the masks are packaged in a way that one finds them difficult to be pulled out easily one by one. The ear loops get tangled inside the whole pile of masks. I have to unwrap the pile to handle the masks every time to pull out one. The packaging should be done better to allow less touching of the remaining masks.",Canada,2020-12-12
4,Great mask,This mask is comfortable and easy to breathe. I feel the quality is better than most masks I have used.,Canada,2020-09-05
5,Comfortable certified masks,Really good masks. I keep a box in my car. Its a proper mask. I went to the hospital and they let me keep this mask on while they were making other people change to hospital masks since this one is proper. They are also a good fit.,Canada,2021-01-05
5,"Good Fit, Prevents Fogging of Glasses",I wear glasses and this brand of mask prevented them from fogging up in the cold! I'd say they prevented about 90% of the fogging that I'd get with another mask. The metal over the nose is strong enough to hold it's shape and the mask isn't too big. I've bought others that look exactly the same but the earl loops are too big and as a result the mask feels very loose.,Canada,2021-01-24
5,Awesome deal,Great masks for a great price & delivered super fast! Canadaüëçüèº,Canada,2020-07-30
5,Bleu et blanc!,Blanc d'un c√¥t√© et bleu de l'autre. Il ne manque qu'un c√¥t√© rouge pour qu'on puisse dire que ce sont des masques bleu-blanc-rouge. Mais je ne crois pas que √ßa en ferait des masques plus appr√©ciables.,Canada,2020-11-24
4,Good quality Level 1 masks,"Good quality and price, great to see it's been tested to meet ASTM Level 1 standards. Mask can be a bit tight fit at first, but gets more comfortable the more you wear them. Ear loops can also snap if you frequently take off/put on the mask. Otherwise it's been good use for me doing non-procedural work in a clinic.",Canada,2020-10-28
5,Doesn't fog glasses,Good quality mask. It doesn't fog my glasses which always the problem of glass wearer. Light but passed the candle test. You don't need frequent adjustments and no smell.,Canada,2020-09-11

Dislikes: nothing really",Canada,2020-10-12
5,Excellent produit,"J'utilise ce masque pour le travail. Pour en avoir essay√© 2 autres mod√®les diff√©rents, c'est de loin le meilleur. Il s'ajuste tr√®s bien sur le nez et emp√™che d'embuer les lunettes lorsqu'elles sont port√©es en m√™me temps. De plus, il est tr√®s confortable, m√™me en faisant 2 tours derri√®re les oreilles. Et il r√©pond √† la norme pour un masque chirurgicale port√© en milieu de travail.",Canada,2020-11-09

Material thin and weak.",Canada,2020-09-14
5,Not like cheap masks I have tried.,We‚Äôre on our second box. Not like cheap free masks offered in some shops with folds that don‚Äôt fully expand to offer good coverage. I tie a single knot in each loop to create a perfect fit. I think these are superior masks.,Canada,2020-12-07
5,Worth money,It is very good. The cheapest surgical mask that I found on amazon. Product is worth money. Normal face mask can‚Äôt prevent us from COVID. Only surgical/procedure above level mask works.,Canada,2020-11-16

1,Elastic breaks right away,"I've pulled out 3 from the box, and all three had the elastic torn off from the mask. These can't be go to mask if it breaks that easily. You get what you pay for.",Canada,2021-01-02
5,These are the ones you're looking for!,"There are plenty of these types of masks being sold, yet these masks are the good ones with the wire inside that actually bends around your nose. The others have that weak wire that doesn't bend well enough, so anyone who wears glasses will have them get all fogged up as a result. Buy these ones to avoid that annoying occurrence.",Canada,2020-07-28
5,Works for me.,Tried several other types but glasses would fog up; these ones are easy to put on and a quick adjustment on the nose wire should alleviate the fogging issue.,Canada,2020-12-19
5,"A little pricey, but good product.","I actually wanted to order the masks that were on sale, but couldn't find them, and unfortunately had to pay a lot more for these, but I really needed them. But they are good masks.",Canada,2020-10-02
5,Great Product,"The product is exactly as described, a great surgical mask! I bought the 50 pack for $19.99, which is about 40 cents a mask. Little expensive..

4,Would buy again at the same price.,As these products aren't individually wrapped one needs to be careful removing them from the package so that the elastic ear holders don't come off. Must be gentle.,Canada,2020-10-03
1,THINKA PROCEDURE MASK WITH EARLOOPS,"I have ordered this facemasks before and had no problem with it. Last order was for 50pieces again and about 30 pieces had no nose clips on it, very disappointed.",Canada,2020-08-10

5,Super Legit Product,"In a time of Covid scares, this mask is everything. It is made of nice thick material and has extra wide nose clip. I feel safer and more protected! As with all masks, it becomes a little hard to breath over long period of time but that something we gotta live with.",Canada,2020-12-31
4,Good deal with astm certified,"It says ASTM level 1 on the packaging. I looked around for different masks, it's easy to find a cheaper one than this. I also looked outside amazon.

5,Great masks,These are very good masks. I ordered them based on the reviews and I am glad I did. Great masks to use during the covid 19 pandemic. These masks really seem to be protective. They are also a great price.,Canada,2020-12-14

5,Easy to remove and use with a slight flaw.,"Packaged well and easy to remove. It happened first to my wife when wearing the mask, the left side of the strap simply snapped or came off. This very same thing happened to my mask today and also to the left side.",Canada,2020-08-14
5,Good to have. Stay safe stay protected,"It came together with my other package, the box is cracked but thankfully it got a inner package and that one is packed perfectly. The mask fits perfectly and it doesn‚Äôt have any odd smell.",Canada,2020-09-25

4,Great masks. Reasonable price,Great masks. Comfortable and packaged very hygienically. They are soft and comfortable. Ear pieces have lots of stretch and don‚Äôt break. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a 5 is because a few of the nose pieces come out and don‚Äôt stay when you put them back in,Canada,2021-01-16

4,Good value/quality for price,"Quite happy with the masks. Have a huge head..so wish the ear elastics were just a tad longer, but can live with the length. Have trouble breathing with cloth masks so hoping this will make it easier. Good value for the price",Canada,2020-07-21

1,Bad quality,Material makes your nose itchy!,Canada,2020-08-13
3,Not the Best Fit For Me,"They're good quality but they aren't the best fit out there, they kind of go into your eyes, even with the nose part pinched / sized. If you have a larger face or are a larger person, though, these may work for you.",Canada,2020-10-29

3,ASTM level 1 isn't as good as 3,"Don't know why people keep saying Level 1 masks are good.
They don't Stop Covid much...I read that they Stop Only 5% of 0.1 Microns which isn't much.
Spend the Money and get ASTM Level 3 or N95.
Never Ever Cheap out when it comes to your Health..
Never Buy The China Made Masks..Buy U.S or Canada made..United Can masks are Good.",Canada,2020-12-31
5,"A triple threat. Comfort, great price, high quality","These are wonderful masks that fit extremely well on the bottom and snug on the sides so no air goes out or in.

At times my glasses can still fog but the mask holds up better than many I have tried.

I truly feel safer with the ASMR level 1 masks instead of the non medical knock offs.

The ear elastics are extremely comfortable and they have not given any chaffing or discomfort for the month I have used them for 8 hour shifts at work. Keep up the good price and the quality.",Canada,2020-12-10

1,It is not surgical mask,I checked the standard Chinese standard GB T 32610-2016 from Chinese website says it is not surgical mask. It is just regular protective masks. But the title here in THINKA amazon says is surgical and medical. It is lying!!!,Canada,2020-07-25
1,Cheap quality,"The rod for the nose is very thin, it doesn‚Äôt stick to my skin. Cheap quality",Canada,2020-07-30
1,The bands break easily,The masks were comfortable but the bands BREAK SO EASILY even if you don‚Äôt put pressure on it. I shouldn‚Äôt have paid attention to the good reviews. It is not worth the price. Had to return the item.,Canada,2021-01-08
1,False information,"Not surgical mask, false information.",Canada,2020-07-27
3,"Amazon ad mentions medical and surgical, but pkg just calls the item a ""procedure mask""","Face coverage is reasonable for everyday use - shopping, being outdoors, etc. Nose piece adjusts well but wish mask hugged my entire cheek; there is a gap. F2100 is the ASTM standard for protection from splashes or sprays during procedures. Don't know if a surgeon would use this for surgery. The test level to determine whether the mask would effectively protect a surgeon from blood spatter is F1862. The official ASTM info re mask levels of protection can be read online.",Canada,2020-07-23
2,A little underwhelming.,I was very happy to note that this was a Canadian brand so I purchased a box for myself since I have to wear a mask at work. They are comfortable but the straps keep snapping off. I have to use at least three in a day. I am a little disappointed.,Canada,2020-08-30
1,Quality is not the best for the price!,"The quality is very low and as shown in the image almost half of the masks have issues. Once you open one to use, the holding thread falls off the mask. Even tried very slowly and still it happens.",Canada,2020-10-17
5,Yes! Very happy with these. Top quality.,"50 piece procedure masks with loops, made in China, for Thinka Canada in BC (so says the box :) There are so many different offerings on Amazon and in-stores, and the reviews are all over the place... very difficult to make a wise/informed choice. I am very happy I chose/purchased these, and I hope this review can help you with your own purchase.
Fits my average-sized face easily (adult male, 40's); the loops are the PERFECT ""tightness"" (circumference: if I measure around my head, over the ears, to the tip of nose = 61cm, to be exact); the metal wire is plenty long enough to span and contour the bridge of my nose/upper cheeks...10cm to be exact. We had been using many types of good quality re-usable textile masks for months now, but these disposable ones ""breathe"" so much better (air flow-thru). So of course I tested: I could not blow out a candle while wearing; not even close. When I tested with water (hold mask by the loops, and pour water inside mask to see how long it will pool and stay inside without leaking), the myriad textile masks I had been using held water inside for 1 sec, maybe 2 seconds, tops, before leaking/pouring out. These new disposable ones held water easily for more than a minute... I gave up waiting to see how long. The outside of the mask is not even damp. Totally waterproof. Very cool! I tried tearing the mask apart with my bare hands... whoa tough! The box did come ""smooshed"" though (but that's delivery issue i guess). There are many other disposable masks out there, but these are SOLID. Could not ask for better.",Canada,2020-07-26
4,"Not many complaints, just seems like a normal mask","Does not smell bad
Ear straps are good quality (by the way you should rip the ear straps off before disposal so no wildlife gets tangled if the mask ends up somewhere)
Fits well and has the metal band for your nose
Has all the certifications
Can breath easily",Canada,2020-08-31
5,These are the best disposables I have used,"These are exactly as described ! I have a mans head and face and they fit great, they also fit my wife, they easily cover the nose and under the chin as the picture attached. The nose piece is metal so it conforms to your nose and face at the top. They easily pass the candle test ! The ear elastics have a lot of stretch, as the pictures show. The package was secure and no contamination concerns, I also appreciate the packaging date at the end of Aug 2020. A nice addition seeing the report done by euroform, I think it was called and it is attached to the ad.
I definitly have no concerns wearing this as a Covid protection mask and if needed WILL buy them again. They are a bit more than the cheapies, I dont know about you, but our friends and family are worth it. As for delivery, they were delivered in two days.
Be safe out there.",Canada,2020-09-28
5,Not the cheapest but definitely worth the extra money,"I searched through the hundreds of advertisements for face masks and while this company was not the cheapest, they had the best reviews and I now understand why. The masks came fast, they were well packaged and didn‚Äôt smell musty like others have. They have the wire nose piece which bends well to make an appropriate seal around your nose and overall aren‚Äôt too bad when it comes to comfort. Not one of my masks was broken and even when I yanked it off my face it still didn‚Äôt break. Remember that you get what you pay for and that the cheapest isn‚Äôt always the best route to take. For the extra bit that I paid, it was well worth it and I have useable, well made, and clean masks to use.",Canada,2020-07-15
5,Good Quality Mask And Passes The Candle Test,"Good quality disposable mask, good thickness for 3 ply, strong ear loops not to tight, good metal bar for conforming the mask to your nose and face especially if you wear glasses (fogging issues) and most importantly to me they pass the candle test. I tried 5 of them out of a pkg of 50 you cannot blow out or make a candle flicker when you put on the mask take a deep breath in and try to blow the candle out. Very comfortable to wear, reading some other reviews people say some of the disposable masks smell these have no scent. Overall very good mask and awesome price. I will purchase againüôÇ",Canada,2020-08-26
1,Very bad product,"Box arrives in an enveloppe deformed. There is not indication on the box as surgical mask even though on advertising it is saying. The mask material are not good if I compare to others that I used, neither confortable. The side are not good fit. It doesn‚Äôt cover all cheekbones. In addition elastic under ear did brake easily. I don‚Äôt recommend it. It is not worth 30$. It worth nothing",Canada,2020-08-14
5,Quality masks,"These masks are THE BEST in the market. I am confident in my statement as I have tried many different brands. I have purchased multiple of them and will keep buying them until there is no more COVID anywhere on the earth.
They have great nose and chin covering and they are like no other mask in quality.
Purchase them with confidence.",Canada,2020-08-12
5,"Fantastic, just wish they were packaged better","The product itself is great. The nose wire is extremely flexible, much more than some others I've tried, making it fit like a glove. The mask itself is shorter width than other masks I've worn but it turns out I'm really enjoying that. The first one out of the box I sacrificed to determine the construction, because some mask manufacturers out there are putting plastic inside (non-breathable) instead of melt-blown fabric. This product is the correct fabric, melt-blown fabric, in the middle as far as I can tell. The ear straps are comfortable, they are 'fused' onto the product either melted or glued and will only detach when stretched to their absolute extreme and given force beyond what a normal wear and tear would put on it, so I'm confident they will hold up on normal day to day use.

My only complaint is that they come lumped into a bit single plastic package (inside the box) and the plastic package wasn't even sealed it was still kind of open even though it had a sticky seal on it that wasn't pressed together. I would rather either groups of 5, 10, or even individually wrapped, though I suppose that would increase the price. The box was flimsy and does not work correctly since it seems to have bent in transit and does not stay 'closed' anymore to use the pop-top option.

Would buy again though, the product itself works well.",Canada,2020-08-16
1,Unhygienic and cheaply made masks,The masks were thin see through cheaply made in China. NOT 3 layered medical top grade quality masks as described on the website. DO NOT buy from this seller. The box was damaged and the masks were not even sealed. Just thrown into into a wrap and not even sealed. The count was supposed to be 50 masks but far less. Don't know who touched these masks as they are hand wrapped in a plastic cover. Can easily tell that hygiene was not maintained. The box was broken and dirty.,Canada,2020-10-19
5,Real actual non stinking masks!,"Actual level one masks. No stinking chemical lab smell like some masks from some other (one other, you know which) country. I will buy these again. I spent well over a couple hundred dollars ordering masks from different suppliers and... hallelujah! Non stinking actual masks! I think they took all of two days to arrive? (I received non level one, stinking masks on Friday that I ordered beginning of May. True story) Don't hesitate to buy these!",Canada,2020-08-29
5,Well worth the money.,"As more and more stores requiring masks, it's time to start looking at getting some. The price in stores for a box of 50 pieces is upwards to $60 and that seems like price gorging to me. These makes are a great price, when i received them which was relatively quick. They are comfortable to wear, it's almost a one size fits all type of mask. Fits all my family members. The fit around the face is good and a metal wire for bridge of the nose. Comes sealed in one bag. First initial putting it on there is some slight oder but goes away fast when wearing. The smell doesn't make it impossible to wear it. Coverage is also great, covers the mouth and nose and around face nicely. The elastics are great, some put to much pressure on the ears and uncomfortable to wear. These don't do that. These are also lightweight and easy to breath though, actually took on a run once and didn't bother me too much. Not as nice without one but didn't notice it much. Something else to mention, have a family member that has glasses while wearing the mask. They said that the glasses did not fog up compared to other makes they have worn.

Overall, very good masks for the price. Would highly recommend getting these masks before there sold out as they will sell quick. I am happy and will most likely be purchasing more soon.",Canada,2020-09-05
5,Very good but not individually packaged,"These are very good masks, half the price of others I bought in stores that weren‚Äôt this good, but the only downside is that they are not individually packaged, they are altogether in one plastic bag. This wouldn‚Äôt be good if more than one person has their fingers in the bag to grab a mask. In other words, these are not for sharing, they are for one person only. Other than that, they are good. Nose piece can be molded to your individual face, elastic ties seem strong enough. If anything changes over the next couple of weeks after some use, I‚Äôll update this review.",Canada,2020-10-27
2,Not a great fit compared to others,The metal part that bends around the nose does not hold its shape and I feel air leaking in that area and when I exhale some slight air into my eyes. My older surgical style masks have much better and stiffer metal that seals better.,Canada,2020-09-23
5,High quality surgical-grade masks!,"These masks are great surgical-quality masks. I had some old ones that I purchased before the pandemic made surgical masks impossible to find, and comparing the two different masks side-by-side comparison I can say these are pretty much the same. They are comfortable and fit quite well. I have a big face and have no problem getting these to fit properly. The elastics seem quite durable, unlike the cheapo non-surgical masks you can get anywhere. I didn't find any odor to these masks.",Canada,2021-02-01
4,Decent disposable mask (TMP710-3),"These masks have a metal nosepiece that actually stays in place once you bend it. I place the mask on my face, pinch it over my nose, remove it, pinch the nose piece again to make sure it stays in position and put it back on. I make sure my glasses are sitting on top of the mask and this causes minimal fogging. The ear loops are also make of a soft material and are rounded, not flat, which makes them comfortable to wear for a whole day of work. For a 6-8 hour shift, I only take it off once to eat, and I never have to adjust it while I'm wearing it. I do wish that the width (distance from the nosepiece to the bottom, width of the pleats) was slightly larger, so that there is more room to open my jaw when speaking -- but this seems to be the standard size for most disposable masks available to the public. The best disposable mask I've ever worn is made by Halyard, but I don't think they sell to individuals, only bulk supply to institutions. So this mask is the next best thing I've been able to find. If I need to re-use it, I store it in a plastic tupperware container with the ear loops hanging out so that I can take it off and put it on without actually touching the part of the mask that is against my nose and mouth.",Canada,2020-12-12
5,Very good !,"I bought these masks because they are certified medical grade, in case I have to be near people for a certain length of time and to see if they are different; I would say
they seem thicker, very comfortable, well packaged , sealed in a see through bag, inserted in a box that has an opening on top to more easily pull one out when you need one. Very nice and solid on the nose.",Canada,2020-10-07
5,Good,"Good quality. No issues.
We don't wear face coverings unless it's mandatory like Wal-Mart or superstore. So we keep some of these in our vehicles just in case they might be needed. Works as intended. Comfortable for short periods.",Canada,2020-09-23
5,Easy to use and good to breathing.,"This mask it is a very good one. Easy to use, and has the strip of aluminum to adjust on the nose, giving us a great facility to breathing. I already purchased the second box of this mask. I recommend it for everyone who need to use an excellent mask to protect themselves against the Covid-19. I strongly recommend this mask for everyone who wants an excellent mask.",Canada,2020-10-26
5,great mask for the summer Cotton is just too hot.,So many scammers out there... saw mask prices in stores 5 for 5$ far better deal. This company is legit going to order many more boxes on my second box,Canada,2020-07-18
5,Does it need a gismo to work.,"Greetings,

Those are white but they are as useful. They were built not to cause discomfort. A coronary transplant takes a whole day.
In my hole practice, I never saw those mask gismos.

Best of Health",Canada,2020-08-27
5,These masks....,"I have to be honest, these masks initially kind of pissed me off...but not for the reason you might think. Hear me out. It's not because they're bad, but because they are SO MUCH BETTER than the previous package I got from a different seller/different brand.
These really stand out. The prior package I got from the other seller was pure junk in comparison. If I had known there was such a difference in quality, I would've thrown out the other ones and gotten these months earlier. Very happy, and feeling much safer with these.",Canada,2020-10-18
4,Good quality for the price,"These are a typical mask, so they are no different than others around. They don‚Äôt fit any better or worse. I don‚Äôt find any of them particularly comfortable but they get the job done for a decent price. The one thing I was disappointed in was just these description. I couldn‚Äôt find what level these were. They are a level 2 which is fine. They came in a timely manner and were packaged well",Canada,2020-10-17
3,not well made strap,I'm not impressed when I put on first and second mask and the same piece comes undone.,Canada,2020-08-03
4,Procedure Face Mask,"Masks shipped with a 'certificate' (ha!) detailing quality standards. Yes, made in China (Guangzhou Yu Ran Film Ll). Box arrived in a bubble wrap package. It was almost flattened - I had to laugh. Contents were sealed in a plastic bag inside the box. They work / do what they are designed to do. Similar to batch I had from Costco.",Canada,2020-08-09
5,Comfortable to wear,"This is a level 1 medical mask approved by Health Canada. More comfortable to wear (fabric is softer, fits better around the chin, sides and nose). I secure the nose piece so I can wear my glasses over top in the office but going outside wearing this mask, my glasses do fog up. Our office has level 1 medical masks for staff to wear, I ordered these for my home and family.",Canada,2020-12-15
5,Fit me well,"Bought these as they actually claim to meet a standard. Fit my male face, with beard, well, good fit around the edges - bit big for my wife. We have some that we bought in Japan, they are sold there in different sizes, my size being 175 mm, my wife 150mm. So, these are equivalent to a 175mm size mask",Canada,2020-12-07
5,Good quality and comfortable to wear,Even though these masks are made in China they are good quality and comfortable to wear. Unlike some other disposable masks these ones have virtually no smell and are constructed well to last for a few hours. Yes there are a few suppliers out there that make these masks in Canada but the price is double for the same quality and filtration. I highly recommend these masks for this price.,Canada,2020-12-04
5,Excellent Protection,"Excellent Quality
These masks fit very comfortable. Excellent protection for school and places where physical distancing can be difficult. The 3 layer protection is added peace of mind. Suitable for high school kids and adults.",Canada,2020-11-24
5,Meilleurs masques que j'ai essay√©. Bien ajust√©s au visage.,"Excellent ! Tr√®s confortable ( habituellement les masques sont trop grands pour moi, mais ceux-ci sont parfaits).
Un masque bien ajust√© augmente son efficacit√©.
Je suis immunosupprim√©e (lupus), je cherchais avant tout un masque de qualit√© : Certifi√© ASTM niveau 1 (BFE et PFE de 99,8 %).",Canada,2020-08-13
5,Excellent product. Exactly the same as local drug stores,"I had been purchasing packs of 10 at a local IDA, for approx $11, and these are identical for almost 1/2 the price. There are ""thinner"" versions out there, and this is not one of those. Only quibble is that the metal band isn't always exactly on center, but it is always above the nose.

Would recommend, and if this damn silliness continues I will purchase again.",Canada,2020-09-07
3,on the small size. medical grade?,"There is no way of knowing if this is a good product. A lot of nice things on the Amazon web site, but nothing written on the box about being of medical grade. Why would I trust this product (knowing that many Chinese masks were of poor quality).
Other than that, it looks good but is rather small so it opens on the sides.",Canada,2020-08-14
5,One of the Better Disposable Masks,"These are much better than the last two other brands of disposable masks I bought. They are soft, appear well made, elastics don't stretch out with use, and the box has opening on top which is a bit handier for getting masks out without touching the others. I recommend this.",Canada,2020-12-21
5,Wife approved,"These are the masks you want. Sturdy, comfortable, thick, clean, Canada approved, not one complaint from my wife about these masks. (Which says plenty).

The last ones we got from Amazon in Feb 2019 were flimsy, uncomfortable, thin, smelly, unapproved and my wife hated them. Now that is progress!",Canada,2020-10-07
5,Wear A Mask For You & Others!,These are great for the price and function the same as some I‚Äôve spend triple the amount on. They have the bar that allows you to form it to your nose. The straps fit normal. The mask stretches down to cover from the top of your nose to under your chin. Great product.,Canada,2020-12-15
5,Comfortable and fast delivery,"Product arrived quick with Prime (2days). Excellent quality and quantity with a reasonable price.
Certified product with manufacturing date included. No mask smell you get with similar products.

Like then and likely will reorder when I run out.

Recommend this supplier and this product.",Canada,2020-07-31
4,"Doing it's job! Nothing more, nothing less!!","Since the CNESST (Qu√©bec) made it mandatory to wear these type of mask at work, i did'nt have a choice to buy some. Those one we're on top of the search list propose by Amazon at a decent price. So i bought them.

They're doing what they're suppose to do. Nothing more, nothing less.",Canada,2020-11-22
5,Great quality,"After trying different masks I was hopeless until I saw the reviews for this mask. Indeed, great quality. The product has all the features advertised, including a metallic nose piece that works. The size is good and the material is comfortable while robust. This is the second time I buy these masks and I recommend it!",Canada,2020-12-05
3,Hard to Breathe!,"Though these masks are lightweight and fit well with metal nosepiece, they are VERY difficult to breathe in. I'm finding far more breathing resistance than the last two sets of masks (different manufacturers) I've purchased during the pandemic.

No chemical smell as others have mentioned, but, unfortunately, unusable for me!",Canada,2020-10-21
3,Seem good and comfortable,Delighted to have masks that fit my face without falling off or bending my ears. Quality seems good and I like the flexible nose grip. The only complaint is the box is damage and the packaging is tore upon arrival however this has been resolved.,Canada,2020-12-07
5,As advertised,Have no complaints about these masks compared to others. They do what I need them for. Also haven't encountered elastics breaking that have been reported by others so I either got a better batch or didn't treat them as rough as others might have.,Canada,2020-12-24
5,it is the law to wear inside public spaces,"Keep box in car. Preferred medical mask rather than cloth as cloth masks may be more of a fashion statement than offer any protection worth mentioning. These Thinka masks with earloops, and nose adjustment are easy to put on, can be left under the chin when outside, then just reapply, fast and simple.",Canada,2020-07-20
4,Ok,"Mask is ok. Because of covid-19, price is higher than normal is understandable. Comfort satisfaction I would say 8 out of 10. Gently open and daily use without problems.",Canada,2020-08-03
1,NOT made in Canada,"The only reason I purchased these is because the description said they were made in Canada. In fact, they were made in China, which is something I wanted to avoid. False description and deceptive. I am sorry I trusted this company.",Canada,2021-01-17
5,My favourite,"This mask is soft, comfortable and fits great. The nose wire provides a nice secure fit over the bridge of your nose and above your cheeks for better protection overall and less or no fogging while wearing glasses. I have tried other procedure masks that were a sloppy fit or hurt my ears. These are great.",Canada,2020-12-12
3,Good only for short time use.,"I like that they are clear, which was the main reason why I bought them, but they don‚Äôt stretch at all. They tend to tear easily when compared to the blue or green nitrile products. They are no good for longer duration use. My nails tend to poke holes on them after a while.",Canada,2021-02-05
5,Best medical masks so far for people who wear glasses,"These masks are made well - and the wire nose piece fits better that all the other disposable masks.
They come in Blue or you can order them in Black. They fit a bit smaller than the other medical masks so I really like them.",Canada,2020-11-19
5,Bon produit dans l'ensemble,"Bonjour,
Le produit est un peu moins doux sur la peau que les masques qu'on trouvait dans les h√¥pitaux, mais c'est quand m√™me confortable. Le colis est arriv√© √† la date pr√©vue en bonne condition pour l'emballage.
Merci.",Canada,2020-09-26
1,Mask Elastic come off.,Don't recommend. Every second mask elastic come come off. Manufacturers use some kind of hot gun to attached this elastic to mask. Cheap quality. All 50 mask i use only has of them. Please go for other product,Canada,2020-09-13
5,Good mask,Since we need them to stay safe these seem to be good. Just hope that they do the job that they are designed for.,Canada,2020-12-01
4,Bon masque,"Le masque me fait tr√®s bien avec un visage long. Au lieu d'un grand emballage de 50 masques, il sera mieux d'avoir 5 petits emballages de 10 masques chaque. C'est difficile parfois de sortir un masque sans que d'autres sorts en m√™me temps.",Canada,2020-11-05
5,Very Comfortable Procedure Masks,These are procedure masks commonly used by dentists. They are very comfortable to wear. They are as described on the website.,Canada,2020-09-01

4,Good quality. Metal nose clip keeps its shape.,These masks are better than quite a few other brands I've bought and came in proper packaging. The metal nose clip stays in place which means my glasses don't fog up nearly as much.,Canada,2020-08-31
4,Does the job!,"Did usual protection that a mask should do !
A bit hotter than usual.
Seller can save on the packaging. Outside box unnecessary. Add any information on inner bag.",Canada,2021-01-15
5,Arrived fast in 8 days and good packaging.,Arrived fast in 8 days from Ontario. Good packaging no damage. Made in Chinese a .looks like any other masks. I bought so far. Hope the ear loop don‚Äôt break. Thanks,Canada,2020-09-11
5,Workable and useful,Unfortunately these masks are necessary right now do to Covid 19. They fit and are comfortable. If you wear glasses I find these the best in terms of fogging.,Canada,2021-02-03
5,I am sure these offer better protection than cotton,The masks are good quality and offer more protection than some cotton ones. However I wish thry offered smaller sizerso they wouldnt ride up into my eyes,Canada,2020-12-16

Very pliable.",Canada,2020-10-20
4,Excellent Value and Quality,"Good forming to nose and face due to the aluminum strip entire width.
Not as easy to breathe as other 3 ply masks.

3,Not bad,"Not bad, except that many of them have one ear loop broken.",Canada,2020-09-21

5,Good fit and stays up on nose.,Good fit and seems to be a quality product. The nose fitment is the best I've seen.,Canada,2020-10-17
5,Can feel the difference,Can definitely feel the difference between this mask and the other non medical grade masks. Much harder to blow out a candle with this one.,Canada,2020-10-11
5,"Great, solid masks! Comfortable to wear and easy to put on!",I like that they're comfortable and easy to put on. I use these masks for every day travel for buying groceries and going to and from work. Highly recommend the product!,Canada,2020-10-04
5,good value masks that pass the test,"Good value masks, they past the ""candle"" test and seem well put together for the price. We trust them and have been using them - a lot.",Canada,2021-01-15
5,Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase.,"They have arrived on time, neatly packaged and seem comfortable to use.One of the reasons why I bought these masks is that it is written they are surgical masks so good protection against virus and I've realized from the reviews that my glasses are not supposed to steam up while using these masks which is an edge over cloth masks.",Canada,2020-08-16
5,"If you have wear a mask, these are good","I loathe wearing a mask, but it's mandatory at the moment in stores. With plenty of these on hand, I can use a fresh one every time.",Canada,2021-01-02

1,False Representation by Seller,"Per the pictures posted by the buyers, the masks are only produced to China standard T32610-2016 which is general purpose daily NON-MEDICAL mask. This is the manufacturer disclosure in the box. Please Google and look up online. This mask cannot be at North America ASTM level 1. To be considered equivalent, the masks need to be produced at China standard YY/T 0969 (which is China's standard for general purpose MEDICAL mask) at the minimum.
We were looking to buy medical masks and therefore looked up online to verify.
It does not mean that this mask is useless and no good. Just that it is NOT medical mask, not ASTM level 1.
Seller misrepresents.",Canada,2020-07-30
1,A good mask is KN95 and not 3 ply disposable mask.,"Thinka gives an illusion that these masks are best for dust for COVID or better than the other 3 plies disposable masks. The truth is that 3 plies are good but KN95 is better. In fact, all 3 plies masks are usually certified and they are more than 95% efficient. These mask surgical not a surgical mask. Kn95 is a surgical mask.",Canada,2020-07-25

4,extremely well made,it fits extremely well. I like the way it is sewn. I was suprised to find 3 filters included. they will be great when temperatures will be lower. too warm for summer. UPDATE: after washing few times they are much much better,Canada,2020-07-31
4,Good stuff,"We have a number of different masks but these seem to be a family favourite because it fits around the back of the head and eases pressure off the ears.
I bought these when the price was reasonable.
It‚Äôs a pity the price has increased because of demand. For this reason I gave them 4 stars. Fortunately a lot of other companies have not increased their prices.",Canada,2020-10-15
4,Back band adds extra security and reduces ear strain,"With a person with a physical disability, I love the back band. Even if the ear loops slip off, it stays on my face. They are meant for a fairly larger face... I wouldn't mind if they didnt cover so high up near the eyes as much. That said, it covers from the nose to under the chin. Lighter material would make them less hot, but overall a really good quality mask that is soft material. I ordered these for me, but my teenagers liked them too so I ordered a second set.",Canada,2020-09-22
4,Decent but filter doesn't cover nose,"Very comfortable. I was looking for a comfortable mask, not medical grade, but with a tight seal to make me feel a little safer on a necessary flight. These have a pretty great seal except just under your eyes where there is a small gap. Filter covers your mouth but not your nose (tried it on my adult sibling and myself who are very different sizes and both noticed the same thing). This is the biggest con of these masks, as the fabric is extremely thin and you can easily blow a candle out while wearing without the filter (an easy way to check how effective a cloth mask is). Definitely wouldn't buy again but don't completely regret buying because they are comfy and we obviously need a bunch of masks kicking around our homes right now....",Canada,2020-08-31
4,A comfortable mask and needs a filter insert.,The backstrap allows you to wear it down around your deck without any problems. Even though I live in Canada where warmth is not a factor in a mask as far as I‚Äôm concerned and really can‚Äôt tell you except the material is quite thin though effective,Canada,2020-11-03
4,Comfortable mask,"Comfortable to wear, fits well and easy to breathe through. The back head strap does take the pressure of the ear straps off your ears but I found I needed to have it near the crown of my head for it to work. Overall, not a bad mask.",Canada,2020-09-22

4,Increased safety.,Great for hubby but a bit big for me.Covers nose and hooks under chin for safety. Would love them if available another size.,Canada,2020-11-25
4,Great for under safety gear,"I bought adult small/medium. The maskd are thin but have good quality filters.The back strap holds it firm and takes pressure off the ears when wearing a long time.

These masks while very comfortable and certainly able to do the job don't have anything that tightens the fabric around the nose.

Which I'm sure helps with the breathability but if you're like me and you have large framed glasses they're useless. Due to not being able to tighten the nose my glasses are fogged up and were unable to clear, as every time I breathed out the fog got worse.

If they had a wire to tighten the nose up these would be absolutely perfect.

This for me I've given the ones I've purchased my father, who doesn't wear glasses, and works in a very physical job doing air duct and furnace maintenance. He has said they work perfectly for him and he absolutely loves them. The headband does not interfere with any safety helmets, hearing protection or safety goggles that he needs to wear, unlike mask that just go over his ears.

The thinness works great for being able to wear under his industrial mask when he needs to. Adding extra protection but not taking away any breathability",Canada,2020-09-07
4,Ok mask,"Nice mask, not good for work as it lets too much air out around the nose and fog‚Äôs safety glasses. Also had to cut the spandex strap at the back as it was too short to fit on my head. It would have been a nice feature.
Good mask to just go in a store. Not for use while working with safety glasses.",Canada,2020-08-06
4,Decent non-medical grade mask,"I have a medium sized head but this fits me like a glove, it isn't too tight and it seals all the way around with no facial hair. I like that it isn't made in China and it comes with a filter even though it's not a medical grade filter it's better than nothing. You can't breath through your mouth with the filter insert however your nose is above the filter but still inside the mask. Your options with non Chinese made masks are pretty limited but I was pleasantly surprised with Safe Mate.",Canada,2020-08-23
4,Comfortable,Comfy and snug. Doesn‚Äôt pass the lighter test though. At least I look like Kakashi Hatake.,Canada,2020-08-08
4,Works well.,"Easy to wear, comfortable to wear of longer periods of time and stays on without ear annoyance.",Canada,2020-08-17
4,small fitting around head,is to tight for either myself or my husband to wear even cutting off the back of head strap,Canada,2020-08-18
4,Not bad for a underoo mask,"First of these are almost exactly like pictured. They do have an elastic band that connects the ear loops and just DOESNT work so I had to cut it off.

Once removed they are fairly comfortable for my wife but a little small for me. That being said they stretch decently, can be work all day.

The onlymother concern is the material. It's the same soft cotton used for underwear. Just FYI. You'll have painties on your face.

Take that how you will.",US,2020-07-28
4,"Good masks, but the strap is poorly designed. People with large heads should get the size L.","These masks fit me well, and I think they look good. It covers the entire bottom half of my face with no gaps, which is excellent. The material is lightweight and comfortable.
HOWEVER: I have some suggestions for improving the design and some info that buyers may want to know.
1.) The elastic strap connecting the ear loops is not adjustable and cannot be removed without cutting it off. This is probably my biggest criticism. This automatically makes the sizing an issue for people with larger heads, so if you are someone with a large head you should definitely go for the larger size option.
I think a better design for this would be a removable and adjustable the strap. Alternatively, if the strap was not one solid peice but rather two peices that connect with velcro or a button or something, that would also be an improvement because it would make the masks easier to put on. As it is now, the only way to put the mask on is by putting it over your head and then adjusting its position on your face. This will probably mess up your hair if it is not cut short or pulled up/back. I usually wear my hair in a ponytail when I go out anyway, so this doesnt inconvenience me, but for other it definitely might.
So this is not a good option if you want a mask that is easy to take off and on.

2.) The filter inserts they come with are very thin and flimsy, so I'm not entirely sure how much protection they really add. You can replace them with different ones (and they should be replaced whenever you need to wash the masks anyway), but it's just something buyers may want to know.

Other than that, they seem to be good masks that do their job. The strap is really the biggest issue, so I may alter them a bit for the sake of convenience.",US,2020-07-25
4,Rear elastic strap made it hard to get on. Nice fit after cutting them off!,"Overall, very happy with these masks...WITH ONE EXCEPTION... I‚Äôm a male with an average size head, getting these over my head was extremely hard with the (non removable) rear elastic strap. I had to pull it so much that I was afraid of breaking the ear loops. I cut off the rear black elastic strap and am very happy with the fit. The ear loops are very comfortable on their own. Fabric is soft and there is excellent coverage over the nose and mouth. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll shrink or not, I have not washed mine yet. But would purchase again",US,2020-07-08
4,"All in all a good face mask, but the filters should be dumped.","Finally, after looking for months for cloth face masks that are sized in accordance with CDC and other medical guidelines, I found a mask that actually fits! The Safe+Mate x Case-Mate - Cloth Face Mask - Washable & Reusable masks extend far enough beyond the chin to actually work as a face mask should. The attached elastic strap is helpful, but can become annoying, even painful, during long term (4 hours or more) wear.

The included carbon filters are not HEPA rated, so do not remove or block viruses, probably not even bacteria. The also make breathing very difficult, so I swapped them out for some CDC-recommended non-woven synthetic) filter material.

All in all a good face mask, but the filters should be dumped.",US,2020-12-03
4,"Nice tight fit, very confortable","I really like these masks. The adult S/M fit me just fine. I like the strap in back for two reasons: 1-it keeps pressure off my ears when I wear this for an extended period of time, 2- it allows me to just pull it down and stays around my neck. I like the gaiter style for this reason, but I feel safer with these. The elastic is fits a little weird with my hair down, and it can mess it up when I pull it on, but that is pretty minor to me. I don't mind the logo, and the fit is good with my glasses. It is tight enough to have minimal fogging. I do feel that since it pulls in more when I talk that it gets a bit too damp. I tend to change it out after a couple of hours because of that, but since I am wearing them all day, I like to change about mid day anyway.",US,2020-08-06
4,"Good Fit, but with Tradeoffs","Probably among the better fitting ""general use"" masks we have tried (ordered the Sm/Med). The pleats sewn around the nose and chin allow for a closer fit with minimal gaps around the face for a mask that does not have a formable nose bridge wire. The main downside is that the fabric is soft and easily gets sucked into your mouth as other reviewers have noted. This remarkably decreases when the filter insert is in place. The neck strap keeps the mask more snug to the face and allow you to pull it down when not around others (only pull from the outer fabric to avoid contaminating face with hands) and we have not experienced the ""over tightness"" that others have. The downside of the strap is pulling it over your head during removal and messing up hair (issue for spouse, but not bald me).",US,2020-10-21
4,Smaller than expected,"I ordered knowing it was listed as a medium/small, but I'm only 5'4"" with what I consider most would describe as a ""normal"" head for a woman. I love the idea of the back strap, but because it is on the small side, it pulls the ear straps in an odd direction. As a result wearing the mask with the ear straps on pulls my ears down toward my shoulders. (I said it was odd!) In any case, I'll wear them and I'll know more about the comfort after wearing them for hours when I'm teaching. They are soft and allow me to breathe easily.",US,2020-07-19
4,Good Fit For Me,"The product is very soft to the touch and did not irritate my face. I ordered a s/m and it had a very close fit, which I love. There was no bulking on the side or excess space around the nose. The head band is great and does receive pressure from the eyes, which provides a more comfortable for. Finally, the material is thin, so I think the mask is most effective with the inserts, which came with the mask.

On the bad side, one of my masks came without a head band so I won't be giving the product a five. I also think a better description of the material and the fit should be provided so customers better understand what they are getting. While but thinness and fit worked for me, I can understand why others may have an issue.",US,2020-10-24
4,Very thoughtful design,"If you look at the picture, the stitching didn't line up. The chin and nose piece aren't aligned straight. It pulls on one ear constantly because of this and is irritating the back of the ear. The material is soft and comfortable, the ear loops could be more comforting. The filter pocket is made well and the colors are not overly extravagant. It almost got 5 stars, fix the symmetry of the fabric and you will have a great product!",US,2021-01-18
4,Great mask for talking clearly,"I originally bought this mask because it had the nose and eye region contouring I was looking for. This mask fit as intended there but I find it's a bit excessive in coverage over the side face and under the chin. When worn correctly, it's tight. The very good thing I found with this mask is I can pull the strap below the ears to loosen the hold against my mouth enabling me to talk clearly. This mask isn't my ideal fit but it works excellently in a way I wasn't even thinking about or expecting. I can strap it up when I'm going about my business and loosen it up if I'm talking. One more thing, since this wraps around the back of the head instead of ears, you can pull it down your neck when you don't need it and lift it up when needed.",US,2020-09-06
4,"Great, but at a cost.","Comfort is great, but you have to cut the elastic band off. It pulls the ear straps back AND DOWN, putting pressure on the top of your ear, which only takes about twenty minutes to start hurting. With the band gone I can wear it for hours with no pain and it still feels secure around my ears. Make sure to get filters for it, otherwise it's kind of pointless. Get smart about this stuff people. Get the filters.",US,2020-10-04
4,Great fitting masks,"Great masks, the only reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't a wire to form the mask around your nose. Other then that the masks are great, they fit very nice on adults and if your a crafter I'm sure you could push some wire through the material so it won't leave an open gap between your nose and cheek. Stay safe everyoneüò∑üòÅ",US,2021-01-25
4,good while lasts,"masks are good quality in terms of softness and breath-ability. nice touch with extra strap around the head, my son liked this particular feature - allowed him to pull mask down without losing it.
nevertheless, all three already torn after washing, maybe requires gentle hand wash to last longer.",US,2020-09-16
4,"Best mask I have tried yet, but is a bit small. very comfortable","This mask is very soft and easy to wear. I love the strap in the back, it makes it so easy to pull down the mask without losing it. it appears to be well made and the filter pocket works well. I have a small face and it fits me perfectly, but might be too small for some.",US,2020-12-02
4,Two sizes!,There is a size option I didn't see and ended up with adult Small. Too small. Choose the Large if you are a normal adult. Other than that it's a decent mask.,US,2020-07-17
4,"Comfortable, Soft, questionable durability","Great fit and seems like good soft material. One is fraying after one day‚Äôs use. It‚Äôs coming apart where the elastic strap across the back attaches to the two ear loops, but the other two masks seem fine after a few uses, so hopefully it was just a defect on that one mask.",US,2020-08-19
4,Kinda sorta but not quite,"Bought these for the elastic band and ext feature for the nose. However, the bands placement kinda low still allowed for the loops on ears to be a bother. The ext nose piece was just a bit pointy kinda making for a witchery look. Otherwise, soft, nice color assortment, quick delivery.",US,2020-08-08
4,Big masks,I ordered small/medium but they are still too big for my face. The chin part is too big and just hands down under my chin. Luckily they fit my husband so at least we can get some use from them! He loves them and he loves the strap that goes around your head.,US,2020-09-24
4,Great for those with a small to medium size head/face,Best mask by far and I‚Äôve tried many. Maybe not great for men or those with a larger head/ face. Definitely 5stars for me. I‚Äôm 5ft3 small head.,US,2020-07-13
4,A little hard on the ears,It‚Äôs mostly pretty comfy (as far as masks go. Can‚Äôt wait to go bare faced again) but the ear loops do bare down on the top of my ears which gets pretty sore after a few hours if you have to work while wearing them.,US,2021-01-11
4,Pretty decent masks,They look as cool as you can with this style. If you have a large face it may not work as these don't have alot of stretch. Definitely cut the little straps that hold the other two together. We cut ours and they fit much better.,US,2020-09-11
4,Does the job,I ended up removing the strap that connects the two ear loops. I found that it was too tight and ended up being painful around the ears. After that it fit great and was easy to put on and remove.,US,2020-10-29
4,Soft and comfortable,This product fits snuggly around the face. I like that it has a band in the back because it saves my ears from hurting. It has a slot for a filter but I found that it is very hard to breath with it on. The material is soft and washable.,US,2020-07-28
4,Runs too tight,Came on time in good condition. Well made but way too tight to wear.,US,2020-07-18
4,"Cotton fabric stretches after long wear, but very comfortable","The item is great especially it comes with a 2.5 filter. It is soft as described, but also equates to being a bit stretchy at first. Since its cotton, I highly suggest that you wash and dryer it (vs to hang dry) so that it shrinks it a bit. Now, this is in relation to the shape of my face. Each person's face contour is different.
After I dryer it, it was a lot snug and shaped when I wear it. I don't wear it for more than a couple of days as it stretches again due to the nature of cotton.",US,2020-09-01
4,Comfy mask,Comfortable. Back strap takes some pressure off the ears. Holds a filter but anything wider than about 5‚Äù hangs out of the pocket.,US,2020-12-21
4,"Ok, but better options out there",I had to cut the elastic ear strap off. It was just too annoying. The material is too light weight and sucks into your mouth.,US,2020-12-02
4,Check the fit,Masks were too small for me (6‚Äô2‚Äù male). But worked well for wife and kids. I cut the elastic band and better but personally will use other options based on size.,US,2020-07-18
4,Not the most comfortable,"These mask are fine except for the strap on the back sits kind of low so the ear pieces still cut into my ears. The material is soft enough it does not damage my ears, it just isn't what I thought it would do.",US,2020-09-23
4,Good Fit,"No mask is really comfortable. These, however are well made and fit so well you don't have to keep rearranging them.",US,2020-09-21
4,Sizes Vary,"Seems like there were two sizes in the set of three. Also, I did not notice there was no nose bridge to shape for glasses. Stitching seems solid and the one that did fit me worked well.",US,2021-01-20
4,Feels great but with one flaw,"Feels great, the filters seem to work, only downside I can see is that the filter doesn't cover the nose so you could be spreading or catching the virus through that",US,2021-01-01
4,"Clever idea, but‚Ä¶","Stretchy material is less effective protection according to research. Out of the package with the filter provided, this mask fails the candle test.

I added a Filti nanofilter to increase filtration.",US,2020-10-10
4,Very nice,This was everything it's describe but it didn't fit my face a bit to big so kept falling.,US,2020-11-15
4,Works well,"These soft masks are very comfortable and lightweight. Even with the additional pm2.5 filter, they are easy to wear for extended periods of time.

I ended up cutting the elastic band on one of them and they made it easier to use if you are having to put on or take off on a regular basis.",US,2020-10-10
4,No metal brace,"Looks like it has a metal bracing for the nose, but it does not! Nice quality masks though, picture is a little deceiving.",US,2020-12-19
4,Cut off the Strap,"Once I cut the strap off the back, they fit much more comfortably.",US,2020-12-26
4,fine for what they are,It's very easy for the mask to end up in your mouth as you're taking. I like that it has the band in the back but it also makes it a little tight. I do like the way it is sewn,US,2020-07-30
4,Fit is really small,I have an average size head and these were super tight. the ear rings are not elastic so its has no room for adjustment.,US,2020-07-19
4,Makes your nose look big,"Good masks, but:
1. Makes your nose look big
2. Too tight (can't remove the strap in the back)
3. Hard to take off temporarily (have to take it all off because of the strap in the back), ex: hard to sip a drink while walking outside",US,2020-09-20
4,convenience of not having to take off when not wearing,"I have to use a mask when I am away from my desk. With these masks, i do not have to worry about forgetting the mask when I have to visit other areas of hospital. Only wish it had a metal/plastic nose piece to ensure better fit.",US,2020-11-07
4,Annoying strap but very nice mask material,"After cutting the annoying back strap, they have become some of my favorite masks to wear.",US,2020-09-22
4,tight,very soft but for an adult need to be a little bigger,US,2020-08-20
4,DOES NOT TUG ON EARS Best design I have found,"Comfortable, great design. DOES NOT TUG ON EARS!",US,2020-08-24
4,They fit snug,"They fit snug. Maybe even a little too snug. When you talk, the creep into your mouth.",US,2020-09-02
4,Product didn't come with back straps.,Mask fits well and is very breathable. The mask is a nice snug fit. I thought the 3 pack came with back straps to ease tension off of the ears. My order did not come with back straps so I am a disappointed in that.,US,2020-09-14
4,Soft maybe too soft,Masks are fine but not what expected. Feels more like a face covering than mask. Very soft material just that it doesn‚Äôt g do fit well.,US,2020-12-16
4,Quality face masks that don‚Äôt annoy your ears,"These are great. You don‚Äôt even need to use ear loops to keep faced covered.

Only recommendation is better washing instructions. They will shrink even when hand washed and air dried.",US,2020-10-09
4,Excellent fit And comfortable for everyday,Used daily only complaint the head strap is a little tight. Very comfortable and launder well. Love the nose and chin fit.,US,2020-08-25
4,Comfort,"It gives you an amazing look, very useful comfortable mask. Great deal for the price.",US,2021-01-21
4,As they say,"Is a good product, the only con is that the disposable filter is smaller than the mask it dont fit properly.",US,2020-12-18
4,The mask is too tight,"The elastic between the ear loops had to be removed, and the mask is still very tight. Why not use elastic on the ear loops? Otherwise, it would be spectacular... I guess I have too many brains in my big fat head...",US,2020-07-13
4,N/a,Like it. Thanks,US,2020-08-22
4,Good Value,Soft!,US,2020-10-26
4,good mask if you cut the strap off,Good fit if you cut off the strap. Would have been nice if strap was re attachable but can't think of a time where I would need it anyways. Little stretch with the band but plenty without. Good coverage,US,2020-07-23
4,Probably as good as they get,"Nice to be able to pull down and leave around your neck when not needed. Very happy and will order more to have one for each day,",US,2020-09-05
4,Comfortable,"These masks are great! I like the reusable filter. They fit well on my face. However, I gave them one less star because I wish it had a metal nose piece. My glasses still fogged up but better than other masks I‚Äôve tried.",US,2020-10-06
4,Comfortable,Very comfortable and designed with facial features in mind.,US,2020-08-05
4,Could use a little more support around the back of head.,"For the most part, I am happy with these Space Masks. I wished they would come with an attachable band that would go around the back of the head and take some pressure of always being around the ears.",US,2020-10-20
4,Better than most but not perfect.,These masks fit well except for around the nose. It becomes difficult to breath after a while and I have to adjust it or take it off for a few minutes.,US,2020-10-29
4,Bought it again!,We liked these so well that I bought a second trio for my parents. It‚Äôs nice to have the back strap to pull the mask down around your neck.,US,2020-08-02
4,Good Masks not Great but Great Customer Service,I have yet to find a mask that will stay tightly on you face. This one is the closest I have found. Otherwise the mask is great. Their customer service was great to work with.,US,2020-09-04
4,Not a bad purchase just not as comfortable as I was looking for,Ear straps to short. Made it uncomfortable to wear,US,2020-10-15
4,Comfortable but small,Nice soft material! Very comfortable- Mask is made on the smaller side,US,2020-08-23
4,Durable through washing machine and dryer,Worth the buy. Fits snug. Comes with filters. Best face mask I ever bought.,US,2020-11-18
4,No seal across Nose,"There is no bendable sealer to ensure a seal across the nose. This allows breath to escape and will fog up glasses. Otherwise, these are quite decent masks.",US,2020-09-14
4,Stays put once adjusted.,Comfortable to where once it is adjusted but unfortunately they're not made symmetrical so sometimes feels lopsided on your face. Overall great product,US,2020-09-14
4,Great product,My daughter and I have small faces. Its quite big. If they can make smaller sizes. Great product.,US,2020-08-06
4,Ears hurt otherwise good,"I like the strap, it keeps the mask up. The ear straps hurt after awhile though.",US,2021-01-09
4,The material is soft.,I would have like the back elastic to bea little less tight. other wise mask fits well.,US,2020-07-23
4,VERY TIGHT to face. Muffles speech.,"If you are normally a S/M, size up. Hard to talk when the fabric restricts your lips. Very soft tho!",US,2020-10-24

4,Comfortable,Sits tight to face,US,2020-08-24
4,Mask fits too loosely at the nose. Not good if your wear glasses. Needs wire at nose.,"I generally like this mask design but room for improvement. Mask fits too loose at the nose. Not good if your wear glasses. Wire inside mask at top of nose area would help. They are soft and light, perhaps a bit too lightweight. Vast improvement over the masks that hang from your ears. I'm convinced that if this mask thing continues it will create a new race of people with ""Clark Gable Ears""",US,2020-10-13
4,Small size is a bit large for me. I still use it.,"The small size is a tad bit too big for me (I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô1‚Äù female - maybe I have a small head?). I still use them especially when I‚Äôm exercising. This mask holds on well. Because it‚Äôs tad bit large on me, the extra fabric can get in my mouth as I inhale through mouth with it on. I believe if it was tighter/smaller it wouldn‚Äôt do that.",US,2020-12-13
4,comfortable,"What I like about these are that they are made of a nice material and if your going in and out of stores and want to lower it outside, just slip it down around your neck and pop it back up prior to going into neck store. maybe not so much for the summer but fall and winter comfortable enough to do so.",US,2020-11-16
4,soft fabric with snug fit,"I find this mask a bit tight and uncomfortable, but my son loves them. I need a loose fitting mask with a tight seal, and that is not how this mask was designed. If you want a snug fit, this mask is soft and stretchy and should work well for you.",US,2020-08-24
4,Snug mask but nose stitching is odd,I love the softness of this mask but i dont like how the stitching ends at the tip of nose really accenuating the nose. My husband has a large nose and it looks odd under this mask. I also wish the straps around the neck were adjustable. I still prefer this mask over all my others though.,US,2020-09-10
4,Very good mask,"These masks fit well and are very conferrable.
Our only complaint is the elastic strap that goes behind your head is way too small. Once we cut off the strap and only used the ear loops it fit everyone well.",US,2020-10-31
4,Fits Tight,"The strap between the ear pieces is tight on me, but the nice thing about it is, you can drop the mask down around your neck when it's not needed.",US,2020-11-06
4,good mask with filter. Comfy,"Definitely need the filters with these, but the fit is really nice.
They come with 3 filters.
Love the band around the back of head. Full coverage.",US,2020-09-17
4,Good Mask,Mask seems to be constructed well. The addition of the headband to the mask provides a tight secure fit. Competitive price for the 3 pack - good deal.,US,2020-09-27
4,"Nice Mask, however tight.","Great idea, however flips inside out often and pretty tight on face and sticks to beard/lips. However comfortable/breathable fabric.",US,2020-10-26
4,Cross strap in back is excellent,Cross strap in back is excellent and the covering is nice and tall from the bridge of my nose to well under my chin.,US,2020-12-15
4,Good quality and soft.,Like it a lot. Family likes them too. Wish they weren‚Äôt so expensive for a 3 pack. I‚Äôll order more if they do go down on the price. Good quality.,US,2020-09-16

4,They seem to work just fine,they seem to do the job,US,2020-12-19
3,Better options out there,"I wish I'd checked the return policy before buying. Unfortunately these masks get sucked into my mouth every time I talk even with the filter inserted for added structure. I may end up sewing a centre seam to help them sit away from my mouth since I cannot return them.

They are too small for my husband but the size suits me nicely.",Canada,2020-11-26
3,OK product,The string in the back makes it difficult to take on and off - however it also makes it easy to keep on your neck when not needing to use it. Not good if you have a long nose but easy to wash. Thin,Canada,2021-01-14
3,Would like it to be consistent as I can‚Äôt wear all three due to fitment issues,"These were comfortable
But only two out of the three fit correctly
The grey one was very different than the blue and black ones it fit much larger and just hung down off of my chin, it did not hug or form fit like the others",Canada,2020-10-30
3,A little disappointed,"For reference, I ordered the smallest size. While the band on the back does relieve pressure on the ears, it is as thin as a cheap t-shirt. The inner slot for the filter is so big it really doesn‚Äôt hold the filters in place and you have to keep adjusting it. I had really high hopes for these masks, but was a little disappointed. Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again.",Canada,2020-09-19
3,Ordinary,Jumped up $10 in price i guess as people bought more? Price gorging tactic! Its like any ordinary mask nothing special. Made of cloth.,Canada,2020-10-16
3,Dissapointed,"I had high hopes for these masks. But I found the material was very thin, the mask itself is pretty big on my face and I can't find a comfortable place for the band at the back of my head. These masks were a flop for me. Wouldn't order again",Canada,2020-09-25
3,Is okay,"They are comfy, but the nose part is not secure at all.
With or without my glasses it's not secure at all; would require some customization.",Canada,2020-09-11
3,Back strap not comfortable.,We did not like the back straps. Otherwise adequate. I would not order again.,Canada,2020-10-29

3,Very comfortable but caution if wearing glasses....,"Overall they're ok. The band around your head is nice. They fit nicely on your chin. The included optional filters is a nice touch as well.
My only complaint is that they don't have a plastic or metal strip on the bridge of the nose that you can pinch in order to prevent air from going up to the eyes and fogging your glasses or sunglasses. I would have given them 5 stars if I could wear them with my glasses.",Canada,2020-08-06
3,"UPDATE 2: Nose leak fogs glasses; Love design; excellent design/fit, but too thin","Pros:
- Excellent design
- Excellent stitching
- Comfortable fit on face
- Filter pocket

Cons:
- Gap between nose and cheek
- Thin fabric
- Thicker (and more durable) ear loops may prove uncomfortable over long periods of wear
- Don‚Äôt know what size I received
- UPDATE: Spouse complains it‚Äôs so thin that mask uncomfortably sucks into mouth upon inhalation
- UPDATE 2: Leak around nose fogs glasses during cardio exercise

This is nearly the perfect mask. Two layers of fabric create a filter pocket, the elastic band is comfortable and helps the mask stay secure, and the stitching of the mask indicates a good level of quality.

The design of the mask is what I like best - there‚Äôs a seam that angles just perfectly over the nose, and there‚Äôs what I call a ‚Äúchin gusset‚Äù that cuts under the chin.

The fit is amazing, and the mask simply looks great! The mask seals tightly around the face - except for the gap between the nose and cheek. This gap is unacceptable, and is a bug found on other masks we own (we‚Äôve tried 4 other mask designs now). We‚Äôll affix bendable metal strips over the nose to fix; not the best looking fix, but it works (maybe we‚Äôll slide wires into to top edging of the mask, there‚Äôs space for that).

The mask is thin, and this is what concerns me most about this mask. Light can easily be seen shining through the fabric (see photo - Safe Mate mask on right), with the implication that this product left unadulterated will provide low levels of protection against COVID-19. We‚Äôll insert homemade filters to offer better protection. Most likely, we‚Äôll relegate these masks for protection during outdoor athletics (tennis, cross-country).

I‚Äôve seen some reviewers remark that these masks are made in China - package states they are made in Vietnam.

And as for the size - many reviews commented that the S/M size was way too small, and would only fit a child. I ordered that size for our 6th graded; they are too big for him; my hat size is 7-1/4‚Äù, and the masks fit me perfectly; they also fit both my high-school children who have larger heads than me, as well as my spouse. I don‚Äôt know what size we received - if it‚Äôs indicated on the package, we couldn‚Äôt tell (see package photos, and mask next to measuring tape).

UPDATE:
My spouse wore this mask regularly today; as others have complained, the masks recedes into the mouth upon long-term/regular inhalation. Unacceptable for sustained use.

UPDATE 2: Decided to test mask while jogging outside; leak around nose area caused my glasses to fog up. When I pinched closed that area, breathing was as expected. This mask really needs a way to be secured around the nose.

Revised rating from 4 to 3 stars.",US,2020-08-18
3,poor workmanship,"after wearing it for the whole day at work, the back of my ears are sore and the material is falling apart, strings of thread coming off.",US,2020-07-11
3,Head Strap not helpful for me,"These would have been fine if I was wearing a mask all day, and needed to keep it secure. However, I take my mask off and on throughout the day. What's the problem? It has a strap the goes around the back of your head, to hold the mask on securely. Again, what's the problem? I have a LOT of long hair. To put that strap UNDER my hair (it has to go down around the back of my neck) means either the mask is no longer secure, or my hair has a messy lump in the back. If I put it OVER my hair, then everytime I take it off, my hair gets tangled and I have to re brush my hair. So, this mask is not for me. Except at the gym, when I am moving a lot, and my hair is up in a Poni-tail....Otherwise, the mask is fine.",US,2020-11-05
3,Funky Fit,"I honestly was disappointed with these. I purchased them myself (not a vine item) for a winter trip through a handful of states (Ca, Or, Wa, Id, Ut) as I didn't want to bring a case of disposable masks with me. Without the filter they are decently comfortable but I doubt they would do much in the way of preventing COVID transmission without them. It's easy to get the filters in and out, and I do like the fact they are replaceable (the pocket is big enough to go generic I'm assuming as well). The fit was just kind of funky for me and I found myself going back to the disposable masks I use in lab. The biggest hassle was actually due to the main selling point for me: the support strap. When wearing a beanie this becomes really inconvenient because you can't don or doff the mask easily; you have to remove your beanie first. Normally when grabbing a quick sip of something or w/e, I'll undo one ear and let the mask hang for a bit. You can't do that with this mask, the closest you can get would be to drop it around your neck. However, with the head balancing strap thing that makes it impossible to put back on without completely taking off the mask and starting over. I ended up only using it on the trip when I forgot or couldn't find a disposable mask. I had a similar situation with a vine-provided mask I have yet to review, so take all this with a grain of salt. It could just be my personal preference is disposable masks...",US,2021-01-27
3,Just meh.,"Bought these masks and the ""carbon activated"" replacement filters. The filter doesn't so much to filter out anything you might be breathing in because the fit of the mask leaves too much space between it and your face that you can just feel the outside air coming in around those spaces rather than through the filter. The elastic strap that connects the ear loops around the back of your head makes the earloops very uncomfortable to wear. I gave it three stars because wearing a mask to protect others is important, and I'll wear it outside but it doesn't provide enough protection to wear if going inside and the filters simply provide a false sense of security.",US,2020-12-14
3,Very light-weight and the carbon filter makes it a functional mask that protects well.,"Without the carbon filter insert the air you breathe through this mask is barely being filtrated at all. With the carbon filter in place, air filtration is quite good and the ease of breathing through the filter is much better than any of the heavy duty, triple layered, tightly woven, 100% cotton face masks. They are a recipe for oxygen starvation. For someone like me, who needs to talk to a group, and project my voice, this amount of filtration is a reasonable compromise.. Because there is no metal nose bridge the only way I get this acceptable level of filtration is by wearing my glasses and placing the nose pads on top of the fabric, then the seal is sufficient. I do wish the top edge of the mask contoured lower under the eyes as it comes off the bridge of the nose. The fabric is stretchy, though, and taking a tuck in the fabric with needle and thread toward the back of the cheek bones remedies this. If you aren‚Äôt worried about filtering out harmful pathogens, wearing the mask without the filter or without sealing the nose with glasses, makes you look like you are trying to be careful when you‚Äôre not and you can breath as easily as if you were not wearing a face mask at all. I think a lot of people are wearing thin masks that aren‚Äôt doing anything at all. One problem I have with my order is that the gray face mask is 3/4 inch longer from nose to chin compared to the black and navy ones. The package was factory sealed so somehow a size large gray mask was packaged with the size small black and navy ones. There are no size markings on the masks. I requested a replacement and only hope the next gray one is the right size.",US,2020-10-25
3,Hot and kind of annoying,"These appear to be well made, but the fabric is SUPER hot compared to other masks I‚Äôve tried. Very uncomfortable in hot weather. Also the neck strap is really difficult to manage; these are not good masks to, for example, keep in the car and throw on and off as you go into places. You‚Äôll have to remove the hat and the glasses and crank it over your hair and blah blah. Super annoying.",US,2020-08-09
3,"Great fit, poor protection","I bought these masks after reading a review that said they would only fit pinheads. Having a freakishly small head myself, I've had trouble finding masks that fit. I got the s/m size and it fits pretty well. It's still a little loose, but would probably be fine for someone with a more normal sized head. It's soft and comfortable, and the charcoal filter provides some relief from the wildfire smoke. However, even with the filter, moisture from my breath collects on the outside of the mask. I would not recommend it if you care about protecting others.",US,2020-10-12
3,Not for glasses wearers,"Not the most comfortable with that back strap. A little snug. You may be inclined to forego the ear straps, but mask doesn't hang well. Also, when I wear glasses, no amount of adjusting keeps them from fogging up. Also...my voice is VERY muffled. I can barely understand me, so i doubt others can. Very soft though, so that's a plus. Maybe will try without filter to see if fogging and clarity is better.",US,2020-11-29
3,The most uncomfortable ear loops..not for use for long periods.,"I wanted to like these so much, but the loops for the ears are so rough and working in them for hours has rubbed my ears raw. Maybe it's the shape of my head, but the strap will not stay anywhere other than the back of my neck. This forces these highly sharp, ear loops to pull down on the too of my ears.

If you're needing something for long term wear, I highly don't recommend these.",US,2020-10-16
3,Nonadjustable,"I bought these because the strap on the back should keep the mask from rubbing the back of my ears. The filter does not cover the nose section, it's too narrow for the mask and when I try adjust the mask to have the filter cover my nose, the the material on the mask rubs under my eyes an bunches up under.. The straps are not adjustable so when you put the mask on, it doesn't sit right, no matter where I positioned the strap on my head and the loops still rub the back of my ears which are already irritated from months of wearing masks.",US,2020-08-20
3,I won‚Äôt buy again,Not impressed Not comfortable and the insert makes it to hard to breathe,US,2020-12-04
3,Ehhhh,"They're ok, but I would not spend this again on 3 masks. Super soft and I like that I can put filters in there. Extremely uncomfortable with the elastic strap. We cut them off of ours and they are MUCH better.",US,2020-12-14
3,These are a good idea but need refining,"They are really not sized well, way to big for a 5 ft 1 inch woman and way too small for a 5ft 10inch man.. Would have liked it if it had a bit of a stiffer body so it didn't collapse while breathing which is the same problem with disposables",US,2020-08-18
3,The product works well for my wife,"The only design flaw was making the mask very uncomfortable for larger men. Try making some adjustments on the stretching portion. Then it in my opinion would work well,.",US,2020-12-17
3,"Too loose on the chin, doesn‚Äôt hug my chin",I just received this masks today. They are comfortable but they don‚Äôt hug my chin. They are very loose on my chin area and there‚Äôs a gap between my chin and the mask which is very annoying. The only positive thing I can say is the quality of the mask is nice and soft. That‚Äôs about it. I was hoping they were tighter around the chin area since I got the small size. Don‚Äôt understand why they are huge. I will be returning.,US,2020-08-20
3,Too thin,"I though these were too thin, and better fitting for large male heads. Ear loops are not adjustable, and hence cannot be used for people with smaller frames without knotting or alteration.",US,2020-09-02
3,Soft but suctions to face when breathing,Very soft but suctions to my face every time I breathe in and fogged my glasses terribly. I can't use these masks which is a huge disappointment since the reviews were so good.,US,2020-10-09
3,needs a filter insert,"Very comfortable as claimed. Stays in place.
Only problem is I can feel may breath on my hand when I breathe out.
That tells me that without some sort of filter in place, the mask won't be very effective in protecting others and myself.",US,2020-08-02
3,Additional level of safety,Easy to wear to any place and covers up my mouth and nose completely as well as had multiple layers but I don't really like the connectors but is good otherwise.,US,2020-09-18
3,Feels like putting in a t-shirt with to small opening.,"The photos on the product are misleading. The size is much smaller than the models suggest, made smaller by the elastic band which is only about length of 4 adult fingers across. The result is no different than a mask with too tight ear-loops in that it uncomfortably pulls the ears down. A longer adjustable piece would have been better. If you are knowledgeable in needlework it can be replaced outright or outfitted with something like velcro to be more effective.",US,2020-07-12
3,Too big but durable and comfortable,"These were a little big on my face. I actually cut the ear loops and sewed them small, but these have lasted me forever and they are comfortable.",US,2020-12-29
3,Ok,Very thin. I wear two or wear with another mask if I wear these so it can be a little uncomfortable (if you are wearing two).,US,2020-08-23
3,Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have the nose clip for adjustment,"I like the softness of this mask, but it doesn‚Äôt have the nose clip. It‚Äôs so cumbersome to put the filter in.",US,2020-10-04
3,"Secure fit, but not as comfortable as hoped for","I like that the mask fits securely and there is no air leakage. It is not as comfortable as I had hoped. It sucks into my face when I breathe and the strap across the back of my head really doesn't keep the ear straps from pressing on the top of my ears. I have not found a comfortable mask, but this is the most protective one I have found.",US,2020-09-25
3,"Tight mask, hard to breathe",This mask is little tight. It hurts my earlobe. It looks good but very uncomfortable breathing especially if you put the filter on.,US,2020-09-05
3,need a size small,the size is s/m. I think you should have separate ones for each size. It is too big for my face.,US,2020-09-25
3,Pretty small,I have an average sized head but these s/m masks were too tight. These may work for older children but I would definitely order the large for adults.,US,2020-10-27
3,Too small,These are very very small. They may work for a child but not for adults.,US,2020-10-15
3,Not what i expected,I don't like the label on the outside and it cant be removed. The masks run small. and are hot.,US,2020-08-24
3,too big and too thin,"I got these in size S/M and they are too big for my face and do not feel snug enough at the edges. The fabric quality is not what it looks like on the photos they posted, and the filters are definitely needed as the mask fabric alone is too thin.",US,2020-08-23
3,Redundant Head Strap?,"This mask has ear loops, but it also has a strap that goes around the back of your head. This redundant strap has no added value and makes it harder to put on. Fortunately, you can cut this strap off without too much effort.",US,2020-10-20
3,Good made but adult sizes are way too small,Way too small. Wish the measurements (w/o the ear loops) were provided.,US,2020-09-08
3,Sizes not the same in a pack,"Not equally sized. Significant differences in size amongst the 3 pack of S/M sized masks. Cheap Chinese product. If it happens to fit, it is soft, comfortable, and lightweight to wear.",US,2020-10-09
3,Too Expensive for What You Get,"Started wearing one of them and the black stretchy part that connects the ear loops already ripped. Kind of upset since these weren‚Äôt cheap. The mask still works, but it‚Äôs a little big since it isn‚Äôt being pulled behind my head anymore.",US,2020-09-12
3,A bit dissapointed,Not the greatest comfort but it gets the job done well. It covers the face perfectly but is is too tight on the ears. The band going all around the back of the neck is supposed to relieve the pressure but it actually pushes down on the ears making it worse. I am tempted to cut it off.,US,2020-10-11
3,"Okay for kids, not adults",Way too small for an adult male. Even right on my wife. Works okay for my 8 year old though.,US,2020-09-18
3,Comfy but needs built in nose clip,No nose clip to seal mask so it fogs up my glasses.,US,2020-09-08
3,Comfortable fit but dogs up glasses,"When you inhale, the fabric suck up into the nostrils. Fogs up my glasses.",US,2020-09-30

3,Too tight,"It's too tight on my head. The material is very soft, which is it's only redeeming quality. The strap in the back is more of a hassle then a benefit.",US,2020-08-23
3,Overpriced,Not very comfortable and overpriced,US,2020-09-16
3,Hmm,Not so comfortable for me.,US,2020-09-26
3,Not comfortable,I don‚Äôt like the stitch in the middle that‚Äôs on the nose it sticks out like a beak. It‚Äôs too snug on the face that I can‚Äôt talk comfortably.,US,2020-09-11
3,Shrinks In size after you wash it.,It fits well and looks great but shrinks after you wash it. Now it‚Äôs too tight for my head.,US,2020-08-24
3,Lightweight.,Fist well. I cut off the elastic but it still hugs my mouth and nose,US,2020-10-26
3,Fit was uncomfortable,Uncomfortable and inserts had an unusual and unpleasant smell.,US,2020-09-12
3,Snug Fit,"One size does not fit all. After a couple of washes, the fabric became stretched beyond what was comfortable. Not sure how effective the filters are. Looks cool and I can wear around my neck instead of taking off and on each time, so that makes it very convenient.",US,2020-09-21
3,Large size. No nose guard.,It‚Äôs really quite large and would benefit greatly from an adjustable nose guard.,US,2020-12-02
3,Too late to return for refund!,"Too small fo adults, elastic straps don‚Äôt have enough elasticity!
Can no longer wear, uncomfortable!",US,2020-10-20
3,Would be great but...,"The 2 layers don't adhere to each other, so the inner layer sucks against your nose or mouth when you breathe in. Pretty comfy, but if you have anxiety (especially in regards to breathing) this is not the mask for you.",US,2020-08-26
3,Snug,A lil snug but good material n value,US,2020-08-07
3,Needed to make wearable,Cut the seals tic stap off. It hurt my ears and was externally uncomfortable. Comfortable without the elastic strap. Not sure it is worth the money since I needed to alter and remove some of the product to actually make it able to wear,US,2020-07-21
3,ok purchase,Small size contours my face but still fogs up with glasses. Strechy band doesn't provide extra relief from ears but good for hanging around neck when mask is off.,US,2020-08-28
3,Very small but quality material,Very high quality mask but when they say small to medium they mean child to very small. Doesn't even come close to fitting on a normal adult head.,US,2020-07-16
3,Terrible fit for thin or small faces,This was the worst mask in a year of bad masks. It was huge vertically--covered my eyes and down under my chin. Tried twice and gave them away.,US,2021-02-02
3,Does not stop fogging of glasses,Very comfortable but my glasses still fog up.,US,2020-08-14

3,gave to grandkids,too tight for an adult to wear,US,2020-11-12
3,no gap between mouth and mask,"head strap uncomfortable,",US,2020-11-14
3,"Excellent shape, inconsistent sizing.","Let me just say out of all the masks i've acquired through this pandemic, these masks are by far the most fashionable. I love the cut of the mask, no stupid seam that goes all the way down the face. Just the tip of the nose to add dimension. As a female, it frames my face beautifully however I cant give this a full five stars due to three reasons. One, the mask sizing is inconsistent. Of the three I received the navy and gray were small and the black was large. Two, in regards to males, this isnt going to work for you. Unless you have a smaller frame/head this is going to be too tight and you'll probably be miserable. Lastly, the ""filter"" these masks include, I put this in quotes because the filter, shouldnt even be categorized as a filter, is truly abysmal. It's so bad I thought it was originally lining/stuffing, then laughed when I realized that the scrap I was seeing was the included filter. To summarize, you're essentially paying for a form fitting mask. Style wise thumbs up, but the quality/materials used are frankly not worth the 24.95. If these get upgraded, ditch the logo, make sizing consistent or alternatively offer S, M, L sizes, and lastly quality filters are a must!",US,2020-07-09
3,Good for very large heads and without glasses,"They don't fit close across the nose, so you can't wear glasses without the fog. They fit large. I got a s/m and it's loose on me, although the back strap is nice and I can move it so that things tighten up some.

If you have a big head and don't wear glasses, these will work fine.",US,2020-12-10
3,Great fit on face but inserted filter will not always cover nose air intake,Comfortable to wear but one problem: the inserted filter can move up and down inside the mask. If it moves down it won‚Äôt cover air intake and outflow of your nose. That becomes clear when you‚Äôre for instance outside and a cold wind is felt as directly hitting your nose through the thin cloth face mask,US,2020-09-28
3,Could be more comfortable with a stretchier strap,"These are pretty nice masks that would be idea for wearing on a flight because the straps do not sit around your ears which can cause pressure points when wearing it for a long time, the problem is that the head strap isn‚Äôt adjustable and is pretty tight on me considering my head is kind of small. (Most caps I only had a couple holes left to make it fit snug)",US,2020-08-31
3,Strap too tight.,The elastic neck strap needs to be adjustable; it is too tight for both adults in our family. I liked the fit of the actual mask but for a man with a beard it is not quite the right style.,US,2020-09-18
3,For a teen or female,"People with large amount of hair, will have a problem. Men that wear mask L to XL will have an issue, the mask did not work out for me but it did for my teenage kids.",US,2020-07-16

3,Loose stitching and Thin,You will need to check the stitching on the mask. It is unraviling in places.,US,2020-10-10
3,Large fir very big faces,Too big even for my husband. Seems like nice fabric and the neck strap is helpful,US,2020-08-20

2,TOO SMALL,"From reading the blurb on the Amazon Website, I decided to give these a go. Not sure of the Men they chose to model these, cuz I couldn't even make the straps reach my ears; too small for the average man for sure. I gave mine to my neighbour next door, petite lady, they fit her perfectly, and (HEY) out of every negative comes a positive.",Canada,2020-08-13
2,VERY SMALL ... unwearable,"First, if you have a tiny head these might be okay. They do fit my wife but are WAY, WAY too tight for me ... even after I cut the elastic off the back. Ear loops are so tight that they cause headache and pulled my ears out like Howdy Doody. Actually kept slipping off
Second, this is very thin material. Had they fit, they might be fairly easy to breathe in
Third, credit where it's due, the cut and shape of the mask seems that it would be good IF IT WAS BIG ENOUGH",Canada,2020-08-12
2,I wish I could return.,"I‚Äôm going to give my honest opinion
I‚Äôve had the face masks about a week. No returns or I would be sending them back.
-The nose stitches are not centred, it looks awful
-I can‚Äôt wear it at all with filters!.. filters won‚Äôt sit straight in mask.
-About the same thickness at a disposable one.
-I am 5‚Äù2, my face must be small cus the S/m r too big.
-My ears hurt.
-Strap at back is nice so u can let mask rest around neck but u can NOT adjust it

P.S picture is to show the difference in length. (Sorry I am in the car) One side is rainbow Timbit, it‚Äôs to the back of heal. Next pic u see it‚Äôs at the tip of toe. That line in the middle sits to the side of my nose",Canada,2020-10-31
2,"Tight,","No idea of its efficacy but as for comfort, low marks. I do appreciate that it has a full headband strap which means you can keep it on, around your neck, for easy access when you need to move it up to protection area, but it's too tight, and the other straps - are they supposed to go over your ears? They don't. Not well, anyway. And as for the replaceable filter, would prefer skipping that and just have an extra layer of fabric and washable.",Canada,2020-10-09
2,Not recommend,"These masks are ok. The filter is annoying and when you take it out there‚Äôs a piece of material on the inside that when you breath it will suction to your face making it super hard to breath.

There are many masks out there. These aren‚Äôt the ones.",Canada,2020-11-21
2,Better masks out there,"I bought the multicolour 3 pack, way too tight. No structure to the mask so you‚Äôre eating it when you‚Äôre talking. Strap on the back was a mistake.",Canada,2020-12-28
2,Hard to Breathe,"Comfort wise these masks aren‚Äôt too bad, but if you have a big head I do not recommend. The ear loops are impossible to stretch. Also, you literally can‚Äôt breathe in this thing. Whenever you breathe in the material gets sucked up into your nostrils and it feels like you‚Äôre suffocating. DO NOT BUY.",Canada,2021-01-11
2,Mask,Did not like these. Although I bought because of high rating they were not for me,Canada,2020-11-09

2,Too Small and No Return Option,Product fit is too small. Not really comfortable with the fabric type and design fit. Not refundable per my Amazon account.,Canada,2021-01-11
2,Thin material kind of small and the filter is not a filter,"The filter isn't really a filter... the filter or piece of paper on the right came with the mask ..
The PM2.5 FILTER ON THE LEFT is one of my own... if you're going to advertise that it comes with a filter then it should actually have one...the mask it's self fits snug... hopefully it doesn't shrink when I wash it.",US,2020-07-08
2,Uncomfortable,"I bought these masks because I specifically wants something comfortable to wear for the entire work day. The strap on the back really seemed promising to remove stress on the ears, but honestly these masks are really hard to keep up over the nose and the strap on the back just causes headaches. Seriously thinking about cutting that strap off altogether. The only plus is these masks are really soft material.",US,2020-08-04
2,A soft tshirt on your face. Not very protective.,"This is like having a soft tshirt on your face. It isn't very protective against much, in my opinion. The construction is good so I'm going to add a few layers of thickness to it and allow the insert to function as well. Alone I would not keep it. My mom who us a nurse was not at all happy with this either either. If we were in the same state I'd fix hers as well.",US,2020-07-25
2,Fair mask,"1. Not a fan of masks that when you breath you literally suck in the fabric when you breathe in.

2. The strap around the back of the head does keep the face mask secure. However keep that strap in mind if you are a gal who is concerned about her hair style. Or wearing a winter hat.

Like the filter you ad to the mask for added protection. I find this mask is Better when you place the filter in the mask.",US,2021-01-19
2,Not worth the buy,"One of the worse mask I've ever bought. Although the material is soft and it looks nice on your face, the design is awful. I am a small frame guy and this mask is way too small for me. Unless you're getting it for your small child, adults need the large size. Its real tight on my face and ears.

The strap behind the head is permanent so you gotta put on the mask from the top of your head and its tight to go thru my head. Not very convenient.

The filter is too small for the mask, it doesn't filter your nose unless you adjust it upwards but then your mouth is not filtered. If you take the filter off, when you breath in, the mask get sucked into your mouth and nose and practically suffocating you.

Unfortunately, i gotta give this product a 2 star because of lack of design. Only good thing about this mask is that it does look nice on your face. Comfort wise... nah.. FAILED!",US,2020-09-03
2,"Not a good value, and not a great product.","I've had trouble with cheaper masks, so decided to spend more this time. Unfortunately, these aren't much better, they just cost more. I am an adult, and ordered the small, but these are still baggy. Rather than ease the pressure of the ear loops (as advertized), the elastic in the back actually adds more pressure at the top of your ear, making them less comfortable. There is no metal nose piece, so the mask is baggy around your nose; when using the added filter, you actually suck in air from around your nose, which is exactly what you do NOT want.
This is the last time I will buy something on Amazon which doesn't have free returns. I gambled, I lost.",US,2021-01-21
2,Not good for folks who wear glasses,"These face mask are for you if you don‚Äôt wear glasses. These are very nice face masks that covers up your face properly and are soft BUT... if you wear glasses, it would fog it up completely. The nose section does not have the lining that stops the air from flowing up and that causes the glasses to complete fog up in no time.
Giving it a 1 star for comfort plus one for softness and minus 3 for not taking care of glasses.",US,2020-10-11
2,Fits poorly and no nose wire,"I am an adult female and I ordered the S/M. I wear glasses, so I NEED a mask to fit securely on my nose. These masks do not have a nose wire and therefore do not fit snugly (despite the description saying they do). Also, the chin part of the mask just hangs down. It definitely does not fit comfortably under the chin. I am so disappointed that I paid $25 for these masks that I have no use for üòî",US,2020-09-24
2,Fogs glasses,"It would help if the mask incorporated material to seal the mask around the bridge of the nose like some brands do. Without a better seal, breath escapes and fogs glasses and sunglasses badly. Benefits of the mask: a band that runs behind the head to hold the mask in place (not tight enough for me) and slide-in activated carbon-filter pads that help contain exhaled breath within the mask for extra safety. (A package of 100 pads costs $20.)",US,2020-10-19
2,I don't like how they shaped your nose,"These are fine quality wise, but personally, I hate how they conform to your nose. It makes me think of a witch nose. I don't know how else to describe it, I feel embarrassed to wear them, I plan to send them back, and this is after wearing one to work and feeling self conscious through the second half of my shift.",US,2020-08-16
2,"Great idea, but poor execution","The design and idea behind these masks are very good, but the execution is poor. While the cloth and ear straps are soft and comfortable, I found that these are too small and I have an average head size. It would be much better if the elastic strap was not sewn on one side with perhaps some velcro to allow adjust-ability much like many ball caps. Maybe they'll take my suggestion and I can get a cut of the profits!",US,2020-07-14
2,Strap is not comfortable,I bought these for more comfort because the ear straps can be irritating to wear everyday for 10-12 hours a day. The strap that goes around your head keep catching my hair and pulling it which is really annoying. I think I'm just going to let my kids wear them.,US,2020-09-10
2,Not what I expected,"The ear loops were tight and the mask kept popping off. I do NOT have a giant head. It may work for kids. The filters were nice, but didn't stay in place. The material was too flimsy, it was plastered against my face when I could wear it. I expected more structure in the mask due to the price.",US,2020-09-22
2,Uncomfortable,I strap was too tight and made it suffocating,US,2020-12-02
2,very small,I don't have a large face or head so I ordered the s/m size. It was so tight across my mouth I felt like I was suffocating. There wasn't a millimeter of space between the mask and my face.,US,2020-09-25
2,Won‚Äôt work for teaching.,"Not what I expected. I‚Äôm a teacher and need better protection and more breath ability. Probably would be more breathable without the filer, but I would be sacrificing my safety.",US,2020-08-16
2,Too big.,Very soft but very big for the size(adult S-M) My wife said I look like a Ninja turtle. The bottom chin part doesn't even seal or line up with my chin.,US,2020-12-15
2,way over priced!!,"sounds a good idea to have a banner behind and attach to both ear loop, but it makes very hard to put mask on, became annoying every time when put mask on and take it off.",US,2020-08-18
2,Lightweight but very little support,"Light weight but very little support - wants to fold all the time, even with the filters inserted. Also there is no nose clip to seal that area properly. Sorry.",US,2020-11-29
2,Waaaay too big! Thin fabric as well.,"I ordered the size S/M And the masks are huge! Totally unwearable for me. Maybe I was sent the incorrect size, But since I was told I can‚Äôt return or exchange this I am out of money. The mask material is very thin, (tshirt material) unless you wear with a filter it‚Äôs totally ineffective in my opinion.",US,2021-01-14
2,Who knew there were size options?,"These would have been fine except that I didn‚Äôt realize that they were sized and I ended up with the s/m. If I had noticed the size options as an adult male I would have ordered the l/xl, I am just so used to adult face masks being one size. So I‚Äôm disappointed and feel a little foolish. It would be a good marketing angle to headline that there are size options.",US,2020-12-16
2,Too small,Masks are way too small for adults! Though i was buying a higher quality for the money spent. Would not buy again. Would not recommend this product.,US,2020-11-03
2,Poor quality stitching; will not hold up after washing.,"I purchased these masks based on the good reviews and photos. As instructed, I washed and dried them before using. As seen in the photo, the stitching is poor quality and the masks are already ripping apart even before using them. Would not recommend. There are many other better quality masks out there for similar if not better prices.",US,2021-01-01

2,"It's for kids, not adults",Too small.,US,2020-07-27
2,Suitable for extremely large heads only,"These are gigantic. I purchased these masks because they are listed as size small/medium, but they swallowed my entire face and were even a little big on my boyfriend‚Äôs giant head. Otherwise, they are very soft and seem to be good quality.",US,2020-10-02
2,Sorry,"Pretty uncomfortable, i used it for like two days and then bought one of those gator things which has been more comfortable. Apologies to the company/seller but its just not a good product. Theres better...",US,2020-11-30
2,Sizing varies,"The design see are a good concept except they don‚Äôt all fit the same, and even after washing them a few times before wearing the fabric has a funny smell to it.",US,2020-09-07
2,Not comfortale,Everyone is different but this thing pulls my ears and squeezes my head the strap around the back is why i bought it and ive cut them off,US,2020-09-18
2,Disappointing,Although soft the masks collect and retain moisture. Additional filter only covers mouth area and not nose area which only has two thin jersey cloth similar to t-shirt.,US,2021-01-04

2,For smaller faces,Way too small for me. I did not realize my ears were so far away.,US,2020-07-14
2,Fell apart on first washing,I washed these before I wore them and one of them unraveled at the sewn seams on the initial washing so it won‚Äôt hold the filter.,US,2020-10-06

2,Comfort vs. Safety,"This mask is very comfortable and feels safer than most I‚Äôve been wearing, however, it seems comfort rather than safety is the primary goal here. As a laboratory scientist working with nanoparticles I see the safety flaws in this mask. I thought the back strap could be added separately, turns out that‚Äôs not the case. The entire mask is one component and must be laced over face and head simultaneously. This means when removing it, it‚Äôs very hard to avoid the outside mask surface from touching your face anyway. And the point was to avoid pull on ears, while it still pulls quite a bit. Was hopeful for this product, but will be looking for alternatives",US,2020-07-25
2,Not breathable after 1st wash,"I‚Äôm not sure why these are rated so well? The strap in the back makes it almost impossible to put on. It would be great if the strap had a Velcro closure. These masks are very soft, but after 1 wash, the fabric becomes almost so loose that when you wear it, the fabric on the inside of the mask basically just sticks to your mouth and makes it very difficult to breath unlike when you first wear them and the fabric stays put about 1/2 inch away from your mouth. I will only use these for quick mask wearing.. not for more than 20 minutes of wear. Not a fan...",US,2020-07-28
2,Disappointed for many reasons,"Very uncomfortable to wear. Abric sermed very thin but at least was doubled.
The added elastic strap is too short causing mask to pull against the face too tight. Fabric, though soft enough, is not stiff enough to resist being sucked into a person's mouth when speaking to someone which was VERY uncomfortable!
Not worth the money!",US,2020-10-09
2,They don't fit well,"I don't know who these were made for, but they were way to big for my face, which is fine; I have a small face, but then they were also way too small for my husband. We then gave them to my 17 year old son, and they fit him better, but he said they were more uncomfortable than other masks that he has.",US,2020-10-10
2,Thin Material and Small,"We thought these would be great. They would be very comfortable if they weren't so small. But we were scared to use them during Covid due to the thin material that seems to be a stretchy jersey knit, which doesn't seem to be safe enough according to the latest studies. Had to return them.",US,2020-08-12
2,Very disappointed in these masks.,"I am an average sized woman and ordered the adult s/m. They are too large for my face. No metal in top edge, so you can't get a snug fit there. Material is a thin knit (which I don't see in the description) that does not hold its shape. I will not be able to use these masks.

The only reason I gave them 2 stars is that they are neatly sewn.",US,2020-08-16
2,So disappointing,"Was so hopeful that these would work. Love the strap behind the ears, hate the baggy, soft cotton fabric that clings to nose and mouth when I breathe.",US,2020-08-11
2,Foggy Glasses üëì,"If you wear glasses forget this covering, it needs a nose clip to keep the warm breath from rising into the glasses. The fabric is soft the filter is adequate medium is a bit tight and can be irritating around the top of the ears.",US,2020-09-04
2,Not worth the money,The band on the back is pointless. The filter doesn‚Äôt fit in the mask correctly and it fits strange. It looks nice in the photos but it pretty low quality not worth anywhere near $20,US,2020-11-12
2,Doesn't fit right,Bought these for my family. The band around the back was too tight on each of us so we cut it off and then it falls off your face so it becomes too loose. Very soft and a nice mask but didn't work out at all for us. Waste of money.,US,2020-09-16
2,Look and feel good but ....,"I really liked these however, I purchased them in October. The black one still works. The grey one was poorly constructed and too tight. The navy one fell apart after several washes. so one out of three is too little for me to purchase again. They need better quality control.",US,2021-01-27
2,Difficult to wear,"While these are very soft, the elasitc band around the back hold them very tight on your face. They are made of cotton and with the filter inside, are VERY diffiuclt to breath through.",US,2020-10-26
2,BEWARE,"The pictures show a premium face mask. However, the reality is just another old undershirt face mask.

I do like the loop around the neck so my ears won‚Äôt be sore.

Below expectations indeed.",US,2020-08-30
2,Wouldn't buy again,Material clings to nostrils/mouth when inhaling.,US,2020-08-12
2,Small Face? Skip this one,"This mask is utterly useless for me. There is no way to adjust the ear loops and they're very large. To compensate for that, they put a piece of elastic across the back of the head. Even with that in place, the chin is floppy and allows outside air in and inside air out. While this mask works for my husband, whose head is larger, this is useless for a petite woman.",US,2020-09-02
2,Demasiado sauve,Al punto de que el filtro se mueve y no queda fijo y la mascar carece de estructura que la mantenga fija al rostro. un poco caras para la calidad.,US,2020-09-08
2,Not for large heads,Probably great if you have a small head. I had to cut off the alastic strap and even then it barely reaches the ears and digs in.,US,2020-07-14
2,Didn't get what I paid for,"The masks are nice. However, they did not come with any kind of filter as advertised. Be careful of what you purchase on line. I looked to see where I can contact the seller but I'm unsuccessful.",US,2020-08-12
2,Not worth it,Terrible fit looks like a jock strap on your face,US,2020-11-07

1,Black mask was defective,Black one fell apart at the seam at first trial.,Canada,2020-08-09
1,Not as described - Sold new but look used,"Thickness is fine, comfort not so much. I chose the smallest sizes but somehow they are still way too big. The filter does not fit correctly. The mask does not hold or fit correctly on a face. Not really as described and 100% not like the image. It is somehow better without the filter but that defeats the purpose. Not a smooth fabric. Maybe mine was used? Seems like someone has thrown them in the wash already. I don‚Äôt know. They aren‚Äôt usable. The only thing I like is the elastic strap that connects the ear pieces.... Don‚Äôt buy it. Waste of money actually.",Canada,2020-12-27
1,Do not recommend,Such a disappointing product. Theses masks are the worst. You basically can‚Äôt breath at all with them. The back strap is so tight and the fabric has two layers and one of the layer gets stuck against your nose as you breath. It‚Äôs really not safe. It also has a weird point on the outside and just looks weird.,Canada,2020-08-13
1,These items are not refundable.,It didn‚Äôt say on the order that these masks could not be refunded even if they are too small. Also they pull on your ears. I am not happy with this as I bought 2 packages for myself and one for my daughter‚Äôs boys. That was a lot of money for a pensioner and couldn‚Äôt even return the unopened ones! I am not very happy!,Canada,2020-11-02
1,False advertising on the sizes,I purchased the large size for myself and the fit was great. The problem is I then ordered the small size for my wife and there is no difference in the sizing. Can't return the item so now I'm stuck the masks. Why advertise 2 diffrent sizes if there is no difference.,Canada,2020-10-06
1,False sizing info and no returns,"Ordered size S/M but product arrived as size Adult, which are the same size as the L/XL that I also ordered. Masks seems ok, but it's unacceptable to substitute sizes and not accept returns.",Canada,2020-10-25
1,Not quality material,I don‚Äôt recommend this product. The material used is thin and if you hold it up to the light you can see through it. Not what I would consider a good quality cloth mask. I was very disappointed with this and it‚Äôs not returnable. So it‚Äôs kind of a waste of money.,Canada,2020-11-06
1,Hard to breathe in it,"The fabric sticks to the nose when breathing, which makes it very hard to breathe.
Not worth buying.",Canada,2020-11-13

1,Worst quality. It won't help you to protect yourself,Worst product i ever bought.. they're comfortable and breathable just like inner wears material. You can't use them to protect yourself from covid andnot even from common flu or dust. You mut need double layered filters on order to protect yourself. Not one. Two....,Canada,2020-09-12

1,Package unsealed and opened at the bottom.......,Masks look like they‚Äôre good quality but someone has opened the package before I received the product. Hopefully they weren‚Äôt sampled or used before shipping..... Not very professional to ship a unsealed product when it comes to masks,Canada,2020-09-27
1,The sizing is incorrect. And now no return policy. Stuck with too small masks and $40 poorer,"Sized too small. What normally would be my size doesnt fit. Waaay too small and now stuck withthem, no return policy. Dont buy!",Canada,2020-12-06
1,Don‚Äôt buy this,This product is garbage. Not as shown whatsoever. filter does not fit the mask. It‚Äôs too small. Mask does not fit your face. There is no nose wire to seal it. So wearing it is pointless. And they won‚Äôt let you return it..,Canada,2021-02-04
1,No good.,Useless and bad designed. Will return the product,Canada,2020-09-03

1,Do not buy!,"I purchased these masks to wear when I go back to school in the fall. (I am a teacher) I was looking for a comfortable product that would keep myself and my students safe. This is not the product! The elastic that goes behind the head is super tight and uncomfortable. It is better when I cut the elastic off. However, the thickness of the mask is also flimsy. It gets sucked into my mouth and nose when I breathe. Also, when held up to a bright light you can see light shining through. So...it will not protect you or others from any germs! Very unsafe. I‚Äôm very disappointed that I wasted $25 to protect myself.",US,2020-07-26
1,"TOO BIG FOR FACE, TOO SMALL FOR HEAD, HORRIBLE MATERIAL","This is the worst mask I have ever worn. I ordered the Small-Medium Adult size, and it's HUGE on my face, but it completely squeezes my head because of the band in the back. Basically you need a large face yet small head to fit into this. It also literally suffocates you, it sucks into your face when you inhale and blocks any air from reaching your nose/mouth so it's impossible to breathe even a little bit. ALSO these aren't real filters that it comes with, it doesn't pass the candle blow test and will NOT protect you from anything. The design is overall cheap and terrible. Idk what kinda Frankenstein Megamind-head made this mask, but it's not shaped for humans, and will not protect you, do NOT buy it.",US,2020-10-07
1,Way too Small!,"I bought these thinking they would be great. They are so tight and small that I cannot use them! I even cut the elastic on one, thinking I could then use it, but still cannot, as it is just too small. I even tried it on my 10 yr old granddaughter - still too skimpy. I had read one review before I purchased that said something like, ""what are these made for - an ant?"" I now know what they meant! Wish I could get my money back!",US,2020-10-12
1,Uncomfortable and suffocating.,"I cannot breathe in these masks! I‚Äôve got dozens of different brands and styles of masks, but these were some of the most expensive ones that I‚Äôve purchased. They have a strap that goes around the back of your head. I hate it! The mask moves into my mouth and suffocates me when I breathe or especially when I talk. I have to keep grabbing and moving the mask so much it‚Äôs not worth wearing! It makes me sweat underneath and then the fabric is damp and I feel like I‚Äôm being water-boarded. I wore it to the mall for 3+ hours and couldn‚Äôt remove it. So this review is from a long term mask wearing experience.",US,2020-10-22
1,"Poor design, putting yourself at risk.","These popped up as an Amazon Choice and were highly rated. Do NOT buy these. No nose clip inside fabric where you can bend the metal to get a good fit around nose. That means your breath is leaking out and fogging classes. And since this is the path of least resistance, you are breathing in unfiltered air in this gap between nose and mask. Nothing to adjust the fit of elastic. Buying these would provide marginal protect from Covid, pollen, dust, pollution...

Pros:
- Soft fabric
- Extra elastic to remove pressure and abrasion from around ears

Cons:
- No nose clip
- Too much fabric on inside of mask
- No pocket for filters on elastic side of mask. The better fabric masks have an overlap to help hold filters in place. Similar to concept of a pillow sham case
- Not adjustable

I should have returned them. Missed window. Waste of money.",US,2020-10-07
1,Wrong colors and extremely uncomfortable,"I ordered the black/navy/gray pack and instead received black/blue(close enough)/army drab green.

The strap that goes around the back of your head is made of really rough, cheap material that looks like it will wear through and snap after a few months of use. The strap also doesn't serve to take pressure off your ears as advertised, it actually services to pull the ear loops down even harder onto the top of your ears. The neck strap is also so tight it makes my neck stiff after wearing the mask for an hour. The masks are outright painful to wear.

I ended up cutting off the neck strap to see if the mask would still work, but the ear loops are so loose that the mask falls off your face without the neck strap. I shortened the ear loops myself after cutting off the neck strap, and now the masks are much more comfortable and actually useable. I shouldn't need to make modifications to a product I pay for, in order for the product to be useable, so I am giving a 1 star rating.",US,2020-12-21
1,Not for working out,"This mask is tight on me, after a lot of adjusting. It SEEMS like it would stay up, but it does not. I made the mistake of trying to workout with one on as I read that it is good for that. I have about 12 different masks and this is by far the worst I have used during a workout. I would have been better off loading my mouth full of paper towels. If you are doing any sort of intense cardio, this sucker is going to be all up in your mouth. Very disappointed. The search continues.",US,2020-11-18
1,"Terrible, way too thin don‚Äôt waste your money","These masks are way too thin to be useful
For anything. Holding them up
To a light they‚Äôre actually see through. Even with the filter they‚Äôre useless as the pocket where the filter goes is way too big for the filter. So basically you have one filtered area surrounded by cloth that still see through.",US,2020-12-15
1,"Uncomfortable, low quality and cheap","This mask is like someone cut holes in an old, discount pair of underwear or a sock. Not nice Calvin Klein ones but ones you‚Äôd buy at a gas station.

The pictures and high price give an illusion that you get a higher quality product. The rubber band is especially annoying since it pulls the mask down and makes it unnecessarily tight to constrict breathing. I have been using disposable masks so far and will go back to them",US,2020-08-11
1,Comfortable but Useless,"Pros: sized for smaller head so it fit well, comfortable and breathable

Cons: Breath go straight through so what protection does it provide?

The best use I found for product is to wear it under another mask. Since it is breathable, it keeps the cotton ones from sticking to nose or mouth so they do the protecting, not this product.",US,2020-11-01
1,Worthless. No nose clip.,"Zero percent effective. No nose clip, and tgey fail the fog test instantly. So safety glasses fog right up. That means you aren't breathing THROUGH the mask, you're breathing AROUND it.",US,2020-08-02
1,Poor design,The elastic on the back is too tight (stretching and pulling the ear-loops uncomfortably even with the large/extra-large size) and it doesn‚Äôt have a wire on the nose (causing my glasses to fog).,US,2020-12-03
1,Too Small!,"This was such a strange fit - mask was too large for my face where the chin extended almost 2‚Äù below my actual chin, while the top was just below my eyes. The strap made the mask so ridiculously tight and difficult to both put on and remove. I have a small face and avg size head for my face - I tend to wear child/small size masks and hats and this fit was totally off. Can‚Äôt wear these at all. There must be different batches that were made since the pics of people who have them on don‚Äôt seem to have the same problems that myself and (from other reviews) many others have found.",US,2020-08-19
1,None effective do not buy,Not impressed. Filters do not fit mask. Making mask and filters useless. With filter installed it rides under your nose or in your mouth. Uncomfortable and useless.,US,2020-07-09
1,No longer correct sizing,"We have purchased these masks several times, and really liked them. However, the last 2 shipments the masks did not fit as well anymore. They are now WAY too big. We ordered the Adult SMALL, but they only fit on my large husband, not on me or my adult sons. It would seem their SMALL is now a LARGE. The package just says Size: ADULT, so perhaps they aren't really doing 2 sizes like they advertise. Had to return 2 sets, very disappointed.",US,2020-10-02
1,Small/Medium has changed and these are too big for women‚Äôs faces,"I‚Äôve ordered these several times and loved them, but the order of 3 that I received today are huge and although it says they are S/MED, these don‚Äôt fit at all and are useless to me. Very disappointed this time and will order something different",US,2020-10-03
1,NO ADJUSTABLE NOSE WIRE,If your not worried about glasses fogging these will work. They DO NOT HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE NOSE WIRE ! I wasted $24 on these and they serve no purpose because they fog glasses very very badly! Trash for me may be treasure for you who knows.,US,2020-12-01
1,Terrible unless you have a face twice the size of a normal human face,I got one defective one of the three and they can't possibly fit any face of an adult let alone a child's. Your face would have to be twice the size of a normal human face to fit.,US,2020-09-23

1,Too small. Too Thin. Too Uncomfortable,"The back is stitched into the mask so you don't have the option to only wear around the ears.

Overall probably wouldn't rather have boughten a different brand.",US,2020-08-14

1,Don't buy ths mask,This is singularly the most uncomfortable mask of he four brands I've purchased. its L-XL adult rating is asinine. It's fit around the head is way too small.and there's no possibility of adjustment. the quality of the product is very good but the design is poor.,US,2020-10-31

1,Too small and too thin,Size is too small for an adult. The band that goes around the neck is not adjustable. The material is so thin you can see through it.

1,"Ineffective, Poor Design, Expensive","There are plenty of comfortable and functional masks available at a much lower price. This mask is made of a nice, soft fabric and elegantly packaged, but a number of poor design features render it ineffective and uncomfortable.
1. There is no ""stay"" to bend around your nose. If you wear glasses, they will be fogged every time you exhale because there is nothing to form an adequate seal around your nose.
2. The filter is useless - the filter ""pocket"" sits well below your nose. The vast majority won't pass through the filter in either direction: the only filtering through the single layer of mask fabric. Putting the filter in your pocket will every bit as effective as placing it in the mask.
3. The behind the head strap supposedly relieves ear strap tension, but doesn't. It just makes the mask very awkward to put on or take off. Sounds like most people cut it off, or just toss the mask(s) and use something better.
4. The ear straps are too short and/or not elastic enough to stretch comfortably without constantly pulling on your ears.
So the mask(s) go straight into the dustbin of bad purchase decisions.",US,2020-10-20
1,MASKS TOO TIGHT AND FILTER FLIMSY,"Not sure where these masks were made, but elastic band in the back is too tight for the average US adult. Had to cut off the elastic bands so the mask fits more comfortably, but the ear straps are not elastic, so the mask now sags and draws into the mouth while breathing and talking. The filters provided were the thickness of tissue paper and bunched up inside the mask each time fitted to the face. Stretch fabric is wonderful and breathable. Suggest mfr. lengthen the elastic back strap, changed out ear straps to elastic and use a sturdier filter.",US,2020-07-18
1,Poor protection and poor fit,"This face mask was designed with comfort rather than safety. The fabric is soft and stretchy, the mask is light but the filter placement does not cover the nose. Most problematic is the fact that the mask does not wrap securely around the bridge of the nose. The mask goes over the nose but with no internal wire to give it shape the mask leaves large gaps between the nose and the cheek. This mask feels like protection - but it isn‚Äôt.",US,2020-12-11
1,Poor design,The mast is too large. It was billed as Medium to small. It's way too thin to afford much protection. The filters that come with them have a plastic like lining that you can't breath through so the extra filters are of no use. the double strap system is worthless and cumbersome to use. The straps have no adjustments like most other masks. I tossed everything. Not worth the effort to send back.,US,2020-12-23

1,Misleading description of protective apparatus,Seemed more like an absolute small for teens not Even a medium. They fit neither myself nor my son. What a waste.

A shame cause I wanted to order more, but poor craftsmanship is an issue. And I doubt I can return these.",Canada,2020-08-09
1,Product changed :/,"I ordered 2 packs of these back in August, they were perfect, fit well and no gapping near the cheeks due to the cut. Just ordered another 2 packs to learn that the cut has been changed (less shaped which is clearly easier for manufacturing) the nose bridge on the original ones dipped down lower, fitting closely to the face and worked nicely with glasses. The front of the mask also curved out more, allowing more space for the nose to not feel like it's being pressed on.

I would have highly recommend these masks to anyone, but after the change o would say it's a hard pass. Everyone in my family used these, and everyone is disappointed in the changes, sizing up or down won't change the comfort unfortunately if the same new pattern is followed, as it's too big in some spots and not big enough in others.",Canada,2020-11-02
1,"Do not buy, run away!!","They make the mask look big but it is not, it‚Äôs good photoshop work.
It‚Äôs only good for a five year old child‚Äôs size face. The ropes are too short and cause pressure on the back of your head, and the little rubber cinches come off the rope and there is nooooo way to get it back on which then makes the mask flop off of your face.
Add to that, they shrunk to a laughable size when we washed them, and put them in the dryer. I think I have a stuffed animal that could wear it at least!!!

The height of the mask is so short, it will only cover his mouth OR his nose - not both. It does cover my 3-year-old's nose and mouth. So that's cool, I should be able to use the mask on my 3-year-old instead, right? Wrong. The mask is so wide and loops so long, it dangles off her face. Silly and useless - built for a kid with a disproportionately short, wide head.",Canada,2020-09-04
1,Way way too small. Not Worth the money.,"I ordered medium for my daughter. Her face measures from bottom of chin to bridge of nose 3.25"". I bought medium as that's what the chart said to do. Not even close. These masks are tiny!!! Total waste of money. Even the stitching on the mask across the front isn't centered. You open your üëÑ and the mask pulls down exposing your nose.",Canada,2020-09-10
1,All these masks do is build a false sense of security...,"There is absolutely no redeeming qualities about these masks. 3 layers of cloth, and what is this supposed to protect you from? Not even a chance of attaching a disposable filter? I should have done more homework on this. If you're looking for a fashion statement, buy this. If you're looking for actual protection...find something else with a disposable filter. These will do fine if you don't have any alternative. A terrible buy I regret. If I could give this product 0 stars I would.",Canada,2020-09-28
1,Some Ear Straps Defective,"I ordered this mask for myself and my mother, as we both have petite faces. The fit was a bit loose on both of us (see photo) but the material was odd - kind of basketball short material. Soft lining.

I would have kept the masks but in the pack of 3 two of the ear straps snapped while I was putting the masks on for the very first time. Overall mask seems sturdy but the construction of the ear loops is flimsy/delicate and liable to snap.

Would not purchase again, have returned.",Canada,2020-11-11

In the picture the top mask is supposedly large and the bottom mask is extra large. The large masks are a little to small and the xtra large masks are a little to big. Either way you will be hard pressed to find ones that fit correctly.
Do to their return policy I have revised my original review to 1 star as they don‚Äôt do returns and they were a Amazon featured item which is extremely disappointing.",Canada,2020-11-11
1,Expensive garbage,"These are garbage. All 3 maks which are size ""large"" fit differently. Even though I measured it doesn't fit anyone in my house!! The straps are 1-2inches to long. The masks are lose and literally fall off your face.. see through as well so they will provide no protection. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS.",Canada,2020-08-26
1,this product is not what they portrayed it to be,i disliked the product because they said it was an extra large and showed pics of the mask covering the entire face well it doesn't it dint cover what the pics showed .It only covered my tip of my nose to my tip of my chin the pics showed bridge of nose to throat it is misleading to the buyer as far as comfort have no idea never wore the masks i cant comment on anything but the size and its not the right size to what they say. Im very disappointed i have purchased three sets of masks from different venders none of them fit i have a big face and need a huge mask,Canada,2020-12-29
1,Very upset with these masks. Inconsistent sizing.,"There is no rhyme or reason to the sizing of the masks, what a waste. They‚Äôre great if you get the proper size (good chance you won‚Äôt). But my size medium folded my ears right in half despite having a very small face. I purchased these masks because of the amazing reviews from friends and family but when it arrived it was all wrong. I‚Äôm very upset with this purchase. Doesn‚Äôt seem right to return it after being used.
Despite the company stealing my money, the masks are a good material and pretty breathable. Just wish they would send & manufacture the proper & consistent sizing.",Canada,2020-11-26
1,Too small of a fit. Don't waste money.,"SIZING IS WRONG-TOO SMALL!
These are way too small for a large and do not fit my face. What a huge waste of money and time. Amazon has to put a stop to vendors like this who pull the bait and switch with false reviews. These are absolutely useless to me and will have to accept my loss and (carefully) purchase replacements or just stick with the disposable ones.",Canada,2020-12-05
1,The white ones are not the same size as the black and blue.,"I purchased the black color first and it is great, I purchase blue next to have a change in color and the blue fit great as well.

1,It does NOT pass the match test,"I was really excited to order these because I had read some reviews where people had mentioned it passing the match test... Sadly, that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. I didn‚Äôt even have to blow hard at all, it felt like the least safe mask for these circumstances. Maybe I got a bad batch? Regardless, I‚Äôm very, very disappointed.",Canada,2020-12-23
1,Breathable but at a cost,"honestly the most disappointing $27 purchase I‚Äôve ever made. The material is thin. It‚Äôs nicely made I can give them that but I was looking for a reusable mask that protects from the virus, not allow it to pass through the mask. It doesn‚Äôt pass the match test. Literally one blow and the match blew out (mind you it wasn‚Äôt even that hard of a blow from the mask) I‚Äôm so disappointed and it isn‚Äôt eligible for any form of compensation so I‚Äôm here with masks that don‚Äôt even do what they‚Äôre supposed to.",Canada,2020-10-25
1,Too expensive,"Like other reviews stated, can see through it when held up to light. I was able to blow out a match as well. Glasses fog up. I followed the measurements and my masks are slightly too big. I wouldn't buy again",Canada,2020-11-19
1,Lacking in comfort,So I wanted to try these and see how good they are. Very disappointed. And size was so big. I got the xl and I have a large beard as well. Was still so loose on my face. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend these,Canada,2020-11-05

1,"Total rip off, DO NOT BUY!","These masks are worthless. The cloth does not pass air. All of my breath goes out through the top fogging up my glasses. My breath goes around the mask sending my unfiltered breath out around the edges of the mask. Same thing inhaling. I'm inhaling unfiltered air that comes in around the edges of the mask.

DO NOT BUY Amazon should be ashamed of products like this that give no protection what so ever.",Canada,2020-10-10

Ils sont plus minces que les masques √† deux √©paisseurs que j'ai d√©j√† achet√©s. Je suis tr√®s d√©√ßue. Il semble que nous ne pouvons nous fier aux descriptions.

1,Not good...used masks!,"Received these in a non manufacturer bag It was an plastic bag. Masks were all defected. One had a white residue on the edge of the mask, another mask had holes throughout and one strap on a mask was ripped off. Very disappointed as the reviews from others were very good. Maybe I got a bad set, as these clearly appear to be used and possibly previously returned items.",Canada,2020-10-08

1,OVERPRICED,"came damaged. does not fit face well (ordered a L based on measurement guide). no upper metal clip/band to increase seal closure. one of my masks has a tear in it, not the most durable masks in my opinion.

EXTREMELY overpriced.

2/10 gets the job done of appearing to wear a mask to satisfy mandates and guidelines. a disposable mask is far better but so wasteful to the environment.",Canada,2020-12-16
1,"Poor quality. Not consistent sizing. Torn elastic, no return option",Smaller Than last time I ordered a large .... also elastic is torn right out of the package .

Please send a replacement or reach out to me .,Canada,2020-11-13
1,White XL fit MUCH smaller than black XL,"I have previously bought the black XL size, and they fit great. I ordered a white XL set, and they are too small for me.

This product isnt available for returns, I contacted the seller through their email and they did NOT reply at all.

1,Tiniest face mask,"I ordered the size large (after following measurement guide) and when these arrived, they were the tiniest face masks I've ever purchased. The bag said size large but they were a child's size. I have a very small co-worker that I gave them to and they didn't fit her either. She is taking home to her children. I don't know if the wrong size was in the bag or if this is usual but I won't repurchase",Canada,2020-11-25

1,Uncomfortable and waste of money,Honestly pretty terrible. They pill immediately after being washed so you get this pill feeling when you wear it. The ear loops are thin and uncomfortable.

1,"INCONSISTENT sizing, scratching","Most recent update- I've bought around 5 packs of these. A mix of small, medium, and larges. The sizing is EXTREMELY INCONSISTENT. I received one medium pack that fit like a large, one large pack that fix XL and one small pack for children that fit like my mediums. Generally one mask or all masks in each pack have been sized wrong. Also the more I wear them the more I realize how uncomfortable the seams are. They are scratchy against my face and I find myself wearing these masks inside out to avoid the thick scratchy seams that turn my face red. I'm going back to disposable masks now.

**old review** (A second masks elastic just snapped) I hand washed them once and couldn't shrink them. After further inspection before hand washing I noticed one of the ear bands is torn and about to split in complete half. See in photos. The large is way to big for me and I definitely need a medium. The company is asking me to send a photo of the defective item but there is no attachment option on my app or mobil Amazon site. Therefore I'm posting the defective item on here for the company to see. ....OLD REVIEW..Nice but not a tight enough seal around my face. I'm a woman with a normal sized face and I just need it tighter. **update- The large mask sucked into my nose/mouth when I inhale. I have bought the medium size and no longer have issues. I recommend the medium size if you have issues like me. A proper fitting mask can do wonders.",US,2020-07-09

1,Don't believe the hype,"I bought these because they're on almost every single """"Best breathable, lightweight, moisture-wicking, etc. masks"" list (Rolling Stone, Good Housekeeping, etc.) Do NOT believe the hype. I hand-washed them very well (soap/rinse cycle 3x) using a Scrubba bag (THOSE are great) as soon as they came in, using Seventh Generation no scent detergent. For some reason, these smell like garlic or vinegar. It's definitely not my breath either because I've never had this happen and have been wearing masks every day since April. And, they're HOT. They're even hotter than the paper masks. My face drips sweat underneath these masks. These also made me realize that while they may be moisture-wicking, they definitely are not lightweight and/or breathable. Regarding size/fit, I measured my face per their instructions, and even though I was on the cusp between the Medium and the Large, I got the Large. Even with the Large, if I open my mouth to yawn, the mask slips down below my nose every single time. Lastly, and most important, these hurt behind my ears. It looks like it's going to be soft and pliable, but something about them makes them pull and hurt. Bottom line? Do not buy.",US,2020-08-21
1,Poor fit and inaccurate sizing,I ordered a set of L masks and received a package with both an L and XL label. The overall fit was loose and baggy and easily slid off my nose. I'm a decent sized guy 6'3 and about 215lbs. I've returned these and will be searching for a better option.,US,2020-07-10
1,Flimsy and uncomfortable,"These masks are very soft and totally without any ""body"". If you wear glasses, as I do, you will experience constant fogging of your glasses. Besides, for what they are, they are ridiculously overpriced.",US,2020-07-09
1,Not an XL,This is not a XL. There‚Äôs no difference between Reg and XL come on .,US,2020-06-24
1,"The ""L"" and ""XL"" are virtually the same.","Tried the ""L"" , and found it too small. Ordered the ""XL"". The ""L"" and ""XL"" are virtually the same. The ""XL"" sort of fits, until I speak, then it slides off. I am pretty sure i don't have a ""freakishly large"" face, so I think they need to update their idea of what constitutes ""extra large"". :-)",US,2020-07-23
1,Made in Vietnam,"I searched ""Made in the USA Face Masks"" and this is what Amazon highlights. It's made in Vietnam and you have to wash it before you use it. I'm not kidding.",US,2020-07-17
1,Dangerous. Don't protect against Covid spread,"These masks are so thin and porous that they are pointless in preventing the spread of Covid. When I got them I immediately realized what a mistake this purchase was. I did two of the tests to see if your mask is effective:
1) When you hole them up to a light source can you see through it?
2) Can you blow out a flame while wearing it.
The results:
When you hold them up to light you can see tons of holes. I saw more holes than stars in a country night sky.
I was able to blow out a candle while wearing the mask.

It scares me to know that thousands of people are wearing these wildly ineffective masks. DON'T BUY THESE SO CALLED MASKS!",US,2020-09-02
1,Awful masks. How they have such good ratings is beyond me.,"I spend over an hour trying to decide which masks to buy, and settled on these because of the reviews, but the number of stars and specifically what some people wrote about them. Imagine my surprise then when I got them and they were absolutely awful!

1. The are packaged so you have to destroy the package to try them on. I guess that makes sense given what they are, but I assume it meant I could not return them because I would have immediately.

2. Since I had to keep them I tried them for 1/2 a day. The first issue is they leave a large gap between my cheeks and the bridge of my nose; does not feel very secure to me.

3. And while wearing it the mask keeps slipping off my nose, and almost just as bad constantly feels like it is going to slip off my nose. So I can't wear it without constantly being made aware of it and having to adjust it.

4. The fabric is super thin, and feels like it wouldn't last more than 2 or 3 washings.

5. Similarly the ear loops feel very fragile, like they are apt to break in the not too distant future.

On the plus side it is easy to breath in them, but I would rather be comfortable I am safer from COVID-19 and not have to constantly (think about) adjust(ing) the mask than be less inconveniences by the mask.

Don't waste your money. Look for something else.",US,2020-12-01
1,The WORST masks money can buy,"These masks are horrible! It wouldn‚Äôt stay on my face for even 10 minutes. It kept falling off my nose. Plus, I was sweating profusely under the mask in 70 degree weather and I couldn‚Äôt breathe or talk with the mask on. What a complete waste of money! To top it all off, it appears they sent me the wrong size. The package says medium even though their sticker says adult small. I am so regretting this purchase!",US,2020-08-02
1,Not effective as virus protection.,"There is no nose bridge wire to help stop fogging up your glasses. There is no additional sleeve internally for adding a PM2.5 filter. They are 3-ply and they are comfortable, but they do not seal.",US,2020-07-27
1,Too hot!,These masks are too hot. My face was drenched with moisture and sweat when wearing these. They are also too rounded at the nose. They fit size wise but if you have a pointy nose they will push against it and get painful after about 15 minutes of wearing it. The material is like a bra and starts to pill after rubbing on my whiskers. There is also a large seam that runs down the middle that after the mask gets moist starts to rub on your lips which makes talking very difficult. I do not recommend these masks.,US,2020-07-20
1,"Heavy, thick and Not Breathable!","Difficult to breathe while wearing. Nearly passed out in the store with this on. These mask are awful, we purchased because it was supposed to be a breathable fabric but it was not.",US,2020-07-06
1,Uncomfortable!,They are hot and uncomfortable. Difficult to breathe. Elastic uncomfortable around the ears. Cause headaches. I can only use for a short period of time.,US,2020-07-03
1,NOT XL,"These fit like a large, def not a XL.",US,2020-07-06
1,No.,"Do not recommend.

You can see the holes in the fabric with the naked eye when holding up to light, so you can imagine what's happening at the microscopic level of a virus.

Loose fitting (despite following the measurement instructions), very hot, uncomfortable.

I've gotten wayyyyy better masks that are more comfortable and don't show light through on Etsy. Head there instead.",US,2020-08-24
1,Not As Advertised,"I thought I finally found an extra large face mask that is comfortable for me. However, the XL size is really about a large and the earloops does not really stretch. The extremely tight fit causes my ears to be pushed forward and cutting off the blood circulation on my ears and around my face.",US,2020-07-20
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR PROTECTION FROM CORONA VIRUS,"I bought a 3-pack of large size masks to help protect against the Corona virus. The first thing I did when I tried them on was the lighter test because they felt very thin (even though they‚Äôre 3 layers). It failed the test miserably. The flame went out without much force at all. Almost as if I wasn‚Äôt wearing anything. I was very disappointed because there was a question about the lighter test and the person who answered said it passed the test (the flame stayed lit), but it doesn‚Äôt. The fact that it failed means there‚Äôs too much airflow through the mask. These masks will do little, if anything, to protect you from the virus. The fit was fine although there were gaps around the nose as there is no nose bridge, which I knew when I bought them. I‚Äôm sure these work fine for protecting from dust particles, but that wasn‚Äôt my intention. I wouldn‚Äôt purchase these for any medical purpose.",US,2020-09-09
1,Where‚Äôs the Beef???,These masks are made of the thinnest material. Looks like a mask but can‚Äôt provide much protection. Will be looking for something thicker now!,US,2020-07-17
1,"DANGEROUSLY THIN!!...FLUNKED ""THE CANDLE TEST""","It's horrifying to know that over 50,000 people are walking around with this on their face believing that it's effective.....when it most definitely isn't. These masks are NOT 3-ply......AND....they don't pass the candle test. You can easily feel your breath if you just put your hand in front of the mask......and.......if you subject it to ""the candle test"" they fail. The candle test is to put a mask on and see if you can blow out a candle. Well.....that's super easy.

This company is doing a disservice to the community selling these masks.",US,2020-11-18
1,Check your size. Wrong size sent.,"Ordered a Medium. It was HUGE. The label at one place says ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù then the other says ‚Äúadult small‚Äù. This company obviously made some mistake so I had to order a replacement and am annoyed I have to return. Plus my
Kid won‚Äôt have it for the first day of school",US,2020-09-06
1,XL exactly the same size as L,"Ordered the L size masks. They are too small for me. Processed an easy return for the L masks. Ordered masks in XL. XL arrived quickly, before I could return the L. XL is also too small. Measured the XL next to the L and they are exactly the same (with slight inconsistencies in size among the 6 masks). Processed an easy return for the XL masks. Ordering from another vendor.",US,2020-08-03
1,does not fit as advertised,"These were supposed to be XL, they do not even fit over my ears correctly. Will be returning them.",US,2020-06-27
1,Evaded Questions until After return period; Barrier/Safety Mask/Nano Technology - MEANINGLESS,"The SAFETY masks ordered were advertised as made of 3 layers and also advertised as ""Barrier"" / ""Safety"" Masks / ""NanoFine Cotton Blend"".

I realized that I was be able to blow out candle THROUGH the mask.
I contacted company.
Asked about terms used in product description:
1. To what is this a Barrier / Safety to?
2. What particle size do you estimate that this mask protects against?
3. What particle size do you estimate that this ""NanoFine"" mask protects against?
4. The term/prefix ""nano"" means one billionth (1/1,000,000,000).
But, it does not say one billionth of what unit of measure (e.g. mile, meter, inch, etc.)
And, is the term nano (unit of measure) referring to thread width or pore size?
5. Was all this verbiage meaningless marketing language?

They returned with delays and non-answers, then stopped responding after the product return period ran out.
Barrier/Safety Mask/Nano Technology - MEANINGLESS Marketing terms

I strongly suggest NOT buying these masks, unless you get Actual answers to these questions.
""Money Back Guarantee"" is also Meaningless Marketing terms.
They will delay until the return expiration date, then will not respond any further

VERY DISAPPOINTED - especially in the COVID environment!!",US,2020-12-09
1,Breath goes right through,"I really wanted to love this product but it‚Äôs going to be returned.

Pros: breathable (way too much), soft, comfortable, fits well, is 3 layers

Cons: you can see light through it, you can blow out a candle through it, could see breath come straight out the front in cold air

Got the medium for my 10 yr old son but will be returning because I don‚Äôt want to pay for a mask that doesn‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs intended to do.",US,2021-01-04
1,"Better than nothing, but...","This mask does not seal from the bridge of the nose to the cheekbone area thus making this mask useless for protection from Covid, dust, etc. Also, if you wear glasses, they will fog up due to the gap between the mask and your face every time you exhale. They may work ok for someone with a very small or flat nose as is typically found in China. On the positive side, the masks are soft, comfortable, and have excellent stitching. They are just not suitable for breathing protection.",US,2020-11-05
1,DOES NOT PREVENT COVID-19,"My husband and I both got Covid wearing these masks. We have been wearing masks since March and do not go out without them. We have NOT socialized at all since March. These masks are nice looking, soft, fit well but clearly are not thick enough to prevent Covid. We both came down with Covid at the same time and these masks were the ones we were wearing:(",US,2020-12-02
1,Not a great product,"I liked that they were black and the material was very soft. However, these masks make breathing very difficult and cause the face to sweat. I've worn them multiple times to go grocery shopping since receiving and couldn't understand why my simple grocery runs were becoming so unbearable. At one trip I swapped the mask for a different one and immediately experienced relief. I am sad to be out the money for these since they are unusable for my family. You might like them, but my husband, kids and I didn't. We each had similar experiences while using at different times.",US,2020-09-24
1,XL size is tiny and way too small.,Not at all as described or as pictured on the man with a beard. Size more appropriate for a child. Disappointed as was hopeful that I had finally found a seller with an XL size but not even close.,US,2020-08-10
1,It Doesn't Work For Me,Troubling lack of filtration. Air flows in/out the top of the mask (around my nose) letting in unfiltered air. Also steaming up my glasses. I cannot recommend this item.,US,2020-07-27
1,Bad Quality,"You shouldn't be able to see light through a proper pandemic era mask. When I hold this mask up to the light, I can see the actual light fixture! If you are looking to protect yourself from COVID look for a better layered mask. I'm disappointed.",US,2020-09-20
1,"Falls off even the small. No stretch, no elastic to cover","I thought these were going to be amazing but they‚Äôre not. They are made so poorly and even the small just falls off my adult face. There is not stretch, no elastic and I‚Äôm touching my face way too much adjusting these. And the price is outrageous for the quality. I am returning these.",US,2020-10-05
1,Doesn't pass match test,"These are great fitting and look great, but they DO NOT pass the match test(tried twice to make sure). There is also no pocket for a 2.5 micron filter, which would most likely allow for this mask to pass the match test, so unfortunately this is not winner winner chicken dinner for me.",US,2020-10-04
1,Large mask yet thin and little ear-loops,"The actual mask is decent quality and is comfortable but the ear-loops are on the smaller side. My mask is a little tight which isn't a problem but the ear-loops are so thin it cuts into my ear.

After wearing this mask for a few hours my ears are killing me, and thats new! After a few washes if the ear-loops shrink I wont be able to wear this.

For a $6/mask the ear-loops are awful.",US,2020-12-04
1,Don‚Äôt buy this mask! It offers limited protection!,The mask is breathable however when looking through it in the light it‚Äôs obvious the layers don‚Äôt block sunlight. Don‚Äôt believe this will protect you from inhaling Covid-19. There needs to be real CDC standards and independent lab testing of all masks sold to the public. Masks are a very profitable business but remember they tell you not to use for medical purposes to keep from being sued!,US,2021-01-17
1,"Baggy, even when instructions are followed","The mask was loose and baggy, with poor elastic strength. I used tailor's measuring tape and followed all of the sizing instructions, but the size was ridiculously off.",US,2020-07-23
1,Very comfortable but (unfortunately) totally useless,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It‚Äôs comfortable and easy to wash. But it won‚Äôt stay in place, so it‚Äôs not helpful at all.",US,2020-09-12
1,I don't see HOW they can these three-layer,"I got these today and was VERY unimpressed. They are two layers thick, not three.
I wrote the manufacturer and will probably return due to misrepresentation.",US,2021-01-13
1,No wire so it will not seal,"Not sure why people are giving this a high review. The whole idea of a face mask is to breathe ""through"" the mask rather than around it. This mask doesn't have a way to seal around your nose. It may look like you are wearing a mask, but in reality there is no seal so it is not protecting anyone against virus transmission.",US,2021-02-03
1,When I washed these(before wearing) they tore up on the seams!,When I washed these(before wearing) they tore up on the seams!,US,2020-08-22
1,Poor quality elastic bands.,Cloth is very soft and it would have been a good fit. The elastic is already way too stretched out and they have not even been worn yet. I tried it on my 8 year old and my 5 year old. If it was made with high quality elastic the fit would be great. On one of the elastic bands it‚Äôs already tearing and we just opened the package.,US,2020-10-04
1,No bendable nose tab,"Nice mask...except for one critical thing. There's no bendable strip at the top to make the top of the mask fit snugly across the cheeks and nose bridge. As a result, there's a gap which allows your breath to escape and air to be inhaled. It defeats the purpose of COVID protection and, thus, is a waste of money.",US,2020-09-15
1,Not 3 ply at all!!!!,"This item is NOT 3 ply at all. When I received the pack and opened it, it had a horrible smell to it and the material was very thin and most definitely not 3 ply as described. I held the mask up to the light and the light came through with no problems, why because it's 1 ply junk thin material. I should have known, the label was ""Made in Vietnam"". Might as well put a nylon stocking over your face, you would have just as much protection with that than these face masks. Not as advertised and should edit their description to 1 ply thin material. Will be returning and never buy from this vendor again. If you are buying this for any type of protection against an airborne virus, DON""T buy it because it will not protect you. JUNK MASKS!",US,2020-11-05
1,false sense of security,"These masks lack a critical feature which is a metal strip to fit the mask securely around the nose. The mask which is not cheap allows a lot of air to enter and exit at the nose, thus defeating the purpose of wearing one. The minimum rating is KN95 which these masks aren't. N95 is the best but good luck trying to find one They are comfortable and allow very easy breathing but so what.",US,2020-10-15
1,NOT extra large,"Very disappointing. Not large enough and no nose wire to help get a seal. Description says 3-ply but it is very thin, more like the thickness of a t-shirt.",US,2020-08-09
1,Hold this mask up to light. Light shines right through fabric.,"This mask is right out of the package.
If you hold this mask up to the light, a lot of light shines through it.

1,Don't get this for Covid/Coronavirus protection!,I was outside and thought to put the mask up into the light to see if it passes through. It does and it's worse when I used my phone's flashlight. This is not safe to wear if you're trying to protect yourself from Covid.,US,2020-08-12
1,No nose piece Fogs glasses. allows unfiltered air in and out,I don't think this mask is worth wearing. There is a gap at the nose which is usually sealed with a piece of metal to ensure breath is filtered and not exhausted out the gap. Also it allows unfiltered air to enter through this gap and then into your lungs.,US,2021-01-13
1,No nose wire for secure fit,"These masks could be great - they're comfortable and larger than others I've tried. However, there is no nose wire to help them conform with a secure fit. This is bad for protection and if you wear glasses, it makes the mask impossible to use. Every exhalation fogs your glasses, badly.",US,2020-08-03
1,Be ready to sweat,"I found these masks to be very hot, even in winter. Within minutes, I felt suffocated. Not to mention my glasses fogged up within seconds.
I returned these in favor or the 32 Degrees masks you can pick them up at Costco for much cheaper than on Amazon.",US,2021-01-07
1,Very small and cheaply made.,"Very cheaply made and none too big. I‚Äôm not sure they provide much protection.

The part that loops around your ears, detached from the mask with almost no force. I barely began to stretch the ring to bring it around my ear and it detached from the mask! Now I will have to repair this mask with a sewing kit or return the items. I am so disappointed, and I feel as if I've been ripped off. They essentially took my money and sent me some trash.",US,2020-08-21
1,Not worth it,"I ordered these specifically for working out and they are not as advertised. I find these as difficult to breathe in as any other regular mask. They are fairly soft and comfortable but do not provide any ease in breathing. I have also noticed this mask holds in a lot of moisture and is often damp after a workout and makes my face sweat a lot. Not happy with these and won't buy again. So far, the best I have found are from Athleta and are sold in packs of 5 for $30.",US,2021-01-19
1,Poor quality; ineffective.,These are NOT three-ply. The material is too thin and stretchy to be effective as intended. I will never buy these again and refused to wear them. I‚Äôm beginning not to trust reviews posted on Amazon. This is a perfect example.,US,2020-12-20
1,Worthless with glasses,"Ordered these because of others' reviews saying they don't fog: well, they do, and even worse/quicker than the other masks I'm trying to replace. They're comfortable, but worthless if you wear glasses and want to be able to see where you're going.",US,2020-10-23
1,Don't waste your money on it.,"The mask itself was too floppy. When you go to talk, and take a breath, it goes into your mouth. Mind you, this person who it was bought for is extra large as well. I'm returning because they're a waste of good money.",US,2020-12-07
1,Smell bad and don't provide a good seal,Had a strong odor when they arrived. After I washed them as instructed they still have a strong chemical odor. They leave gaps at the sides of my nose they all the air goes in and out of that area. I don't feel safe with them,US,2020-12-10
1,Better pass this up...,"The material is very soft and comfortable and an ample size. The ear loops are very soft as well. It's easy to be wearing this all day, but it's just not breathable.

1,Don‚Äôt waste your money.,Don‚Äôt waste your money. Theses masks are not good at all. Material is cheap no quality fabric. Water resistant: when I pour water in the middle of the mask it when thru because is sew in the middle. The most important part to over is the nose and the mouth and it is not water resistant. Large size is small. I will love to return the three masks but I already washed all three. If wear make sure to use a surgical mask under. I won‚Äôt use it alone.,US,2020-11-25

1,You may need to order a size up.....,"Not happy at all with this purchase. Received the masks the other day, took one out of the bag to do a test fit. Masked fit great. Not too loose, not too tight. I washed it on cold, then dried on medium heat with other bits of clothing. The damn things shrunk. F*&king useless now. Material is Ok; There seemed to be room to add additional material if one wanted. Won't be buying again. If you do, may want to go a size up from what you normally order.",US,2020-08-17
1,Flimsy,Very disappointed. Used the size chart and these are way too small. The strap broke the first time I put it on and there is no reinforcing seam down the middle as shown in the product photos. It's just a flimsy piece of fabric. Cannot recommend this mask.,US,2020-08-20

1,Silver Nanoparticles,"Had I known that one of the layers of fabric was coated in silver nanoparticles, I would not have bought this.

1,Ear loop are very pooly attached and come off easily - would not buy again.,"I purchased this on Dec 1 2020, 2 of the 3 masks have already had this problem even with only a few hours a day of usage.

1,"Comfortable, but not safe at all.","Whomever said these masks pass the fire test, you are wrong. Air DOES get through these... Like, I can feel my breath outside of the mask when it's on me.

1,Too small and tight!,I ordered the medium size since the product description said that fits most adults. It is too small barely covers the area fro nose to chin.

1,"Too Big, Company Needs to Change Sizing Suggestion","Product says large fits most adults, but the mask is so big on my face that even the motion of walking makes it slip right off my face after a couple steps.

Order a smaller size than large unless you're an absolute unit.",US,2020-08-15

1,Not for covid use- cool wash only,These look good and are comfortable BUT I should have read the washing instructions. Not suitable for use as covid mask as they can only be washed on cool so any virus or bacteria on the mask can‚Äôt be destroyed when it‚Äôs washed. Good as a dust protector only I‚Äôd say.,US,2021-01-22
1,What you should know before you buy these.,"I am making homemade masks, but I wanted to try some masks that are mass-produced to see how they feel and fit. I found these very comfortable and lightweight. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm thrilled with the polyester and I think overall I prefer my 100% cotton home-made masks better.

Be aware though, this mask is treated with ‚ÄúAgion‚Äù antimicrobial agent. This chemical is used by businesses and hospitals to treat surfaces and guard against covid-19/corona virus. It is effective, although Kaiser Permanente recently stopped using this chemical (I‚Äôm not sure why, but I‚Äôm assuming because of safety concern).

By googling ‚ÄúAgion‚Äù I was able to find some information about this chemical, but I am not convinced it is safe.

For this mask, the Agion is applied to the inner layer of the mask. The mask is composed of 3 layers as follows:
Shell layer: 100% polyester DWR
Middle Layer: 65% polyester, 35% cotton
Inner Layer: 65% polyester, 35% cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent

You absolutely need to wash these before wearing them. They recommend it on the package and with the chemical treatment I think you should not wear this mask right out of the package. I am washing before using, but I am not sure that washing actually removes this chemical.

I am also somewhat apprehensive wearing these masks. I don‚Äôt know that I trust the manufacturer of the chemical who says it is ‚Äútotally safe‚Äù. There‚Äôs so many chemicals that have been used throughout human history that end up being cancer causing, so I am very much apprehensive that this chemical is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.

I really wanted to give these masks a good rating, but just the fact they don‚Äôt disclose this chemical is used on the product on the Amazon product page, makes me even more apprehensive. Why did they apply it? Is it removed with washing or does it stay on the fabric long-term. From what I gathered from my internet research, the chemical will be effective for 90 days when used on surfaces.

I doubt most people would even know since the packing is usually just thrown out by the consumer. I can not in my right mind give this product a good rating.",US,2020-06-18

I am not able to determine the type of fabric used. There is no provision for a crimp seal at the nose, but that was never advertised as being there. If you are getting this for virus safety, don't waste your money. Made in Vietnam, but that would not be a problem if the quality was decent. The only purpose this mask serves is if you are required to wear a mask, you can say you are. Might also be useful for bank holdups.",US,2020-07-11

1,"If your child is forced through tyranny to wear a mask, then this is the one to wear",The facts are that this product is exactly as described. It does exactly what the sellers say it does. I‚Äôm giving a one star because the whole idea that we have to wear masks everywhere now in the first place is completely pathetic and ridiculous and I never thought our country would come to this.,US,2020-08-01
1,Too many problems,"These masks are slightly more comfortable than the blue surgical masks. It still pulls too tight on the tip of my nose.

Anybody who says they don't fog up your glasses is crazy. These fog up my glasses to the point where I would rather just toss them in the trash.

One of the 3 masks has a huge discrepancy in the length of the elastic that goes around your ears. One side pulls tighter than the other so can't wear that one at all.

One of the 3 masks has a big dimple in the center of the mask like it was stitched too tight in that area.

I have to talk while wearing a mask at my job. It does not stay on your nose as soon as you open your mouth. And yes, I ordered the right size according to the measurement chart. Pretty much these masks are an all around failure, especially for the price.

I think somebody needs to design a mask that has the metal piece in the bridge of the nose AND a metal piece that can be curved in the opposite direction to hug your cheek.

I would not recommend these. I am going to try something else.",US,2020-10-01

1,Not happy with purchase,"I measured my face as instructed and was well within the LARGE size requirements (4.5""-5.75""). I measured 5.25"". From the reviews and comments I thought I was ordering the correct size as both my wife and I fell within the large range and we could share them. When they arrived they were more child-sized. When they are on if you open your mouth the mask pulls down off your nose. The ear stretch rings are way too thin, flimsy and stretchy and do not hold mask in place very well. If I would purchase the x-large they would undoubtedly not fit my wife.",US,2020-07-19
1,Confortable but...,"I just got these face masks today. I put one on and was a little disappointed. The face mask is very comfortable and light. The material feels very good. I was disappointed, however, as the fit is not tight. The mask does not have a nose wire as N95 and many other masks do. The fit on my nose was very light. I could feel my breathing coming out thru the top of the mask. When I inhale I could inhale particles thru the top of the face mask as well. Not very reassuring. If they had a nose wire I could get a tighter fit. UPDATE: I have been trying to fix the no nose wire thing to make it fit better and I just realized that the mask will not offer COVID-19 protection as it seems to allow small particles like COVID19 thru. I simply cannot recommend these masks and I will not be using them.",US,2020-09-10
1,No,"Maybe this is a desirable product if you're a confederate flag-draped, garbage person from the south, and all you want is a chin strap while you protest your right to die.

Do that, and you'll see how long the three layers take to dry.
We're talking overnight and still damp in the morning.
If anything, these masks are germ retainers and regret containers.
As a bonus, they're not breathable at all.

I bought this because it stated the two inner layers were a cotton blend. Polyester is not a cotton. False description. I cannot wear this mask.",US,2020-12-18
1,Fails to deliver on promises,"Using the provided measurement guide I determined the Large mask would be the correct choice. I found them to be so small that they barely covered my face from the bridge of my nose to under my chin. The loops that go behind the ears are also too small which leads to the mask pulling uncomfortably forward on my ears. The material is so thick it is hard to breathe through the mask. In short, it fails to deliver all the things it promises to provide. A waste of money.",US,2020-10-02

1,Way too small- can't return,"I had high hopes for these masks, however they do not fit properly and are way too small for me. Once opened, I could not return, so am forced to keep these. Even after machine washing per the instructions, they still have a strange odor to them. Not happy with this item or getting stuck with them.",US,2020-07-07
1,Nice Material but non-functional design lacking a wire for making a seal,For masks to be effective they need to have a wire at the bridge of your nose so that it conforms and creates a seal with your face otherwise the air just goes right around it since air will always take the path of least resistance. This means only some of the air you exhale is actually going through the fabric which is how a mask is supposed to catch the tiny water droplets that potentially carry viruses and thus makes them useless.,US,2020-11-03
1,"Poor customer service, even worse product.","I spent the time reading many of the reviews to get an idea about the breathability, tightness and adjustability of the mask. I measured myself twice. I ordered the extra large and it was way bigger (I mean over 1 inch) than what was described in the sellers product sizing chart. I tried multiple times contacting the seller prior to turning it and no one got back to me. Extremely poor customer service and lack of attention to detail on the sellers website and product size description make these masks useless to me and have wasted a lot of my time.",US,2020-12-19

Selected ‚Äòbuy it again‚Äô option and only black color was available. Completely different product in every way‚Äî‚ÄòL‚Äô size is much smaller, super thin straps and poor construction. One big negative about ordering on Amazon is there is little, if any quality control. This means the seller can swap out any item without changing the product details if item is different from the original. That seems to be the case here. I would recommend you look and purchase elsewhere.",US,2021-01-01

Come on guys, someone needs to make a wearable mask for above average sizes.",US,2020-07-09
1,The sizes are off,"The smallest of these masks were for like a newborn or something. The XL covered half my husband's face. I don't know what is going on with these sizes. I bought L, kids small and XL and the large was like normal so I dunno. It was not worth the money since there is no nose clip it just slides off and the ear loops aren't adjustable.",US,2021-01-24
1,Didn‚Äôt fit my kids but fits me,"Purchased a small and it does not fit my 3 year old, 7 year old, NOR my 11 year old.. even with the head adjustment strap i purchased from another seller this mask does not fit. It fits me perfectly though, but not my kids.",US,2020-07-08
1,Suffocating,"I got these so I could stop using the disposable ones. They are soft and have a nice fit and stretch. But I wore it for a few minutes yesterday while I received a delivery and these make breathing so difficult. I'm glad I got to use them before I went to town in the heat. That would not have been good. I washed them all, so I can't return them. I regret this purchase.",US,2020-08-16
1,"Doesn't fit, too thin to be effective","The mask is too small, slides off my face while talking, and does not seal well across my face - too loose with no adjustment option. I measured and selected my size according to the instructions. Having now read other low rating reviews, I agree it seems thin for a 3-ply and ineffective as a COVID mask. A bit disappointed given all the good reviews, even on ReviewMeta. Probably just doesn't fit my face but my other masks (different vendors) do, so I'm returning it.",US,2020-10-26
1,Poor quality,Returned item because the product looked too thin to be able to protect from droplets.,US,2020-08-20
1,Sorry but Amazon did not properly deliver,"Amazon indicated that the product was delivered to a ""secure location"" with no details in the middle of 40 mile an hour winds. The product is very light weight and apparently simply blew away somewhere. Reporting it to Amazon produced no results in their typical no customer interaction. Their typical ""delivery"" is just placed on the front steps. With the winds that day no telling where it ended up? Of course Amazon is unresponsive. Next stop a hold on the credit card charge.",US,2020-12-03
1,Definitely don‚Äôt do their job protecting my nose,"I don‚Äôt recommend these masks to anyone. Mind you, I have an average sized, adult face. They fit so loosely near my nose and kept falling downwards as I talk. The whole purpose of wearing a face mask is to protect your nose and mouth from droplets ... these are not worth it and I highly recommend buying elsewhere.",US,2020-08-02
1,Too thin; costly mistake,"This mask is too thin. I can see through it. The ear straps are very flimsy. I can see no way this mask could possibly be effective in Covid protection.

They're hard to breathe in...feel like I'm gasping for air while wearing and my face just keeps getting hotter & hotter!!!,US,2020-08-14
1,Began tearing the first time worn,I wore the mask for 20 minutes and noticed right away that it could hold up for just 20 minutes. Just normal wear. Clean shaven no reason for snags or anything to cause the mask to immediately begin to tear. Never washed just wore it once.,US,2021-02-02

1,Ordered large a month ago and it‚Äôs not the same size as large now,My family ordered these exact masks in size large a few weeks ago and I loved them. I decided to order the exact same product in the exact same size and this current batch is much larger and falls off my face. That is really annoying and downright bad business practices. Now what? This batch is unwearable.,US,2020-08-01
1,Sizing guidelines are inaccurate,"These masks run small. I ordered an XL and based on the sizing guidelines, I was afraid that it might be too large. Quite the opposite... it is too small.

1,Not recommended,"The 3 masks were inconsistent with one another. Each was a slightly different shade of dark gray.

1,I hate this thing,For someone like me who has issues with claustrophobia don't get this. I tried it on and I felt like I was gonna suffocate on the spot and had to remove it .Even though it's my favorite color black and I thought that's fine might like it make it used to it. No good for me it may work for other people but I've been working with the mental health therapist for years and she's trying to get me used to this mask stuff I find that the gaiter and bandana ones work better for me than these ones these were too they felt kind of thick and I didn't care for that not easy to breathe through that's for sure.We don't really work well in the summer which is when I tried it I seem to make you very A lot harder than what year with the humidity too it's terrible. I didn't like these I'll let my husband try them but if he don't then I'll probably just re home then the somebody that can use them.,US,2020-07-05
1,Smaller than standard paper disposable masks. Nowhere close to XL.,"I've been using standard size paper disposable masks at work as they provide them to us. However I've a large face/head and a full beard, so I decided to order some larger washable masks. These are absurdly small, significantly smaller than the free paper masks.",US,2020-06-12
2,"Disappointed. Not a great fit, terrible elastic at ears.","These were a total let down. They feel and look great, but the elastic is terribly cheap, different lengths and mishaped. I bought 2 packs of 3 small size for my kids (so I didn't need to sew anymore) & only 1 out of 6 fit either child correctly. However, if you can sew they're very easily improved upon. They don't have a wire for the nose, so it constantly slips down under the chin. I sewed a bag tie to the seam and that's fixed the slipping. However the elastic was so stretched out on a few that I had to add beads to them and sew the elastic ends together to keep the beads just to allow for adjustment. I'm being literal when I say the one elastic was so stretched it fit around my head to a high ponytail.",Canada,2020-09-10
2,Masks cannot stay on your face at all if you open your mouth to talk.,"I have ordered the small, medium and XL sizes. For my 6 year old, 9 year old, wife and myself. These masks do not work. I have picked up masks from the corner store for less that work MUCH better (of course they are out of stock now). They fit okay - until you open your mouth - once. Then they fall off your nose forcing you to touch your face. Furthermore - they do not reduce your breath enough to stop the blow out the candle test. On top of all that - I feel hot and breathless when simply walking around with it on. I have ordered others - and continue to use disposables for now.",Canada,2020-09-22
2,Never fit,"The bad
‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨
1. Don't fit very well. Always came down below my son nose. What is the point of wearing the mask when the nose is exposed
2. I improvised the nose's metal holder and still none of them hold well.
3. Expensive for something worth 3 bucks.

The Good
‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨
Nothing good. They are junks. Woodworking is my hobby and I use the RZ masks for both woodworking and covid-19 protection. The RZ is much better and seal very well with internal filters. I wish the RZ have sizes for kids",Canada,2020-10-26
2,Too expensive for the quality,"I expected good quality for the price and reviews given here. It feels really flimsy, especially the elastic band. The grip even on youth size on my face (adult- and I‚Äôm not even close to skinny) feels like it‚Äôll fall off- which means it doesn‚Äôt grasp the face well and allows air to enter from everywhere.
I‚Äôll keep it since it‚Äôs a hassle to return, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it at all.",Canada,2020-08-26
2,They WERE great. Not so good after the second purchase,"They're so good! I wasn't expecting much because they're just masks but they're comfortable and breathable! There is a waterproof side as mentioned
I got the large size and it fits very well.
I will buy them again :)

Update: I bought them again in the SAME SIZE and it was so much bigger than I previously ordered. This makes me so upset because I bought more of these to replace another mask that was too big and unusable. But now these are also too big and unusable even though I bought the same size as before and they were perfect......I can't even exchange them üò≠",Canada,2020-12-24
2,Too small and turned yellow,"I found the size small was almost too small for my average size 5 year old. If you are looking for masks for kids I would recommend ordering the medium size. After hand washing the mask turned yellow when air dried. Not impressed for the price paid. I was able to find similar, if not better, quality masks at a local store for the fraction of the price. I would recommend only ordering the black in my opinion if you‚Äôre still tempted to purchase these.",Canada,2020-09-17
2,Do not recommend,"I wear glasses, so I had to add a wire to the nose area, otherwise my breath just shot up into my eyes. Once I added the wire to seal the gaps it was a little hard to breathe through, so I won't be using it. Come to think of it, if you're breathing through the gaps beside your nose, not through the fabric, that pretty much defeats the purpose, doesn't it? Unless you're one of the nuts that thinks covid is fake and your purpose is to appear to be breathing through a mask so you don't get hassled at the store, but this isn't going to offer mush protection.",Canada,2020-12-19
2,Very hot and sizing sucks,Doesn‚Äôt fit well at all. Bought the XL size based on the measurements in the add. It‚Äôs way too big and bulges out on the sides. Wish I would have gotten the Large size instead. Comfort and softness is good though. They make my face get hot very quickly though. Don‚Äôt recommend these for all day wear,Canada,2020-11-11
2,Quite expensive... and they shrink,"They are quite expensive for having them shrink after the first wash. Even after following the instructions. So now I have to ""play"" a little bit with the position of the mask to cover from my nose to my chin without getting fog in my glasses. So I would recommend a bigger size so you can get the perfect fit after it shrinks.
Mine are Large... It would've been better with XL.",Canada,2020-08-14
2,Inconsistent size,"I purchased these and were very happy and then purchased a second order, same size. The 2nd order, all 3 masks were different sizes and very large. Even on my husband, who the first order was for, these masks fell off his face. 1 mask fit okay, the other two were bigger",Canada,2020-10-15
2,Fits Large,"Bought the masks in a small for my 5 and 7 year old boys. They said ideal for 3-9. Way too big, the elastics are not adjustable so they can not stay on their faces. They do however fit my face and I wear adult-size masks so I think the fit is really off.",Canada,2020-09-11
2,Stylish but not breathable!,"The style is great. The fit is perfect. However, i returned the product since it is too thick which it is not breathable. You will sweat in the mask. If you wear it for like 5 minutes , it should be fine. Anything longer than that, you will sweat. I wouldnt recommend for workout.",Canada,2020-08-31
2,Not comfortable mask,"Masks are soft and feel good on the face, but not for a long time. The ears attachment pinches in my ears and had to remove. Using only for a 30 min. max. Too much money for this 3 masks. I bought for $12 much more comfortable ones.",Canada,2020-10-26
2,"Soft, but lack of a nose wire causes glasses fogging",These masks are soft and comfortable in the short term as long as you‚Äôre not wearing glasses. Since they lack a nose wire they direct a lot of exhaled air upwards which fogs your lenses. In the long term the material used causes a lot of moisture build up on your face.,Canada,2020-08-18
2,Doesn't stay put!,Within an hour of wearing it loosens and starts slipping. Mask gets pulled down by the chin while talking or chewing gum or any other activity that involves opening Jaws! I wouldn't recommend this product.,Canada,2020-11-24
2,quality and size issues,"Purchased the masks thinking they're higher quality. The earband came off the fabric on first use. They use a cheap elastic-band type attachment. Other masks i've used have a cloth ear band. The ear bands are also small and pull on your ears (even though I ordered a LARGE mask).

Large mask is small... order a size up",Canada,2020-09-14
2,The size is weird.,"I'm a female adult with a small face. I followed the measure guide and my measurement is between 3.75""-4"", so I chose the youth size. But when I get them, they are a little tight for me, and more importantly, the length between bridge and chin is just TOO SHORT and cannot cover my face perfectly while talking. So I need to adjust my mask ALL THE TIME when I wear it at work. It's really annoying and I can't return them either... It's such a waste of money!",Canada,2020-11-25
2,Thick and hot,"I found this mask quite thick and hot to wear. I also wish I had noticed there is no nose wire before purchase. As a result, glasses fog up. I'm still looking for a comfortable mask.",Canada,2020-11-13
2,Strap ripped off immediately...,"I just pulled these out of the package and tried one on for size... Immediately the strap ripped off. I noticed the other part of the strap was barely holding on. These masks are a nice fit and very soft, but obviously they were not sewn very well.",Canada,2020-10-20
2,a heatbag!,"LOved the fit, but that does not override the low comfort level, owing to the buildup of heat in the mask.
I had it on for less than 2 minutes when it became unbearably uncomfortable, because of the heat.",Canada,2020-08-14
2,Poor design,"Very nice masks unfortunately there isn‚Äôt a wire on nose section so it slips down
Constantly. Will be returning. Nice fabric, easy to breathe and good quality. Not a Perfect design.",Canada,2020-09-19
2,Order a size up - It's pricey but not worth the money,I'm a medium size but apparently I have to order a size up due to shrinkage. It also gets hot and humid inside the mask which makes it a bit harder to breathe.,Canada,2020-11-01
2,"No metal nose strips, otherwise comfortable","Comfortable, soft. Wish the ear straps had adjustments. Was noted they had metal nose strips but they don‚Äôt so I rated only 2 stars.",Canada,2020-09-30
2,Selected Medium and order was processed as youth/adult small,Not sure if they are out of MEDIUM but this does not fit a female adult well. Too small!!! When you talk it reveals your nose. Adult LARGE fit me better. The small I got were a waste of money.... My daughters in their 20's also felt it was too small. They are on the petite to normal size people..... too bad because the fabric is good.,Canada,2020-12-10
2,Not contoured like the modeled mask,The models are wearing a heavily contoured mask that looks like it fits well. This is far more square and just ramps off the side of your nose. Fogs my glasses immediately.,Canada,2020-11-16
2,Somewhat overprice,"Got it in a day with Prime delivery. But doesn't feel that impressive when I try it. It's light weight but not sure if it is protective enough. Anyway, I think it is a little overprice",Canada,2020-11-29
2,difficult to breath,This mask is difficult to breath thru. It was sucked onto my face when I put it on. It made me feel running out of breathe.,Canada,2020-11-21
2,Comfortable but lacks nose wire and sizing off,Given the high price I expected a top quailty mask. It does feel comfortable but lacks a nose wire/metal strip so a large space is open between the mask and face near the nose. That defeats the purpose? Maybe a larger size would help but I used the sizing guide.,Canada,2020-09-01
2,Large is too small,Sent these masks back as the large size that was suggested for my size of face doesn‚Äôt adequately cover my nose.,Canada,2020-09-14
2,Not premium in any way,Elastic wears out quickly. Fabric is scratchy on the face. I wear glasses and they fog up easily. It does not have a nose fitting to keep it down. I have s hard time determining the inside from outside. I would not recommend.,Canada,2020-08-29
2,Dont recommend,"Did not like them. They had no wire for nose place. Because of this, the mask kept falling off my nose.",Canada,2020-10-15
2,Very Uncomfortable On The Ears,"The fit is great and the fabric is soft, but the elastic straps have almost no padding and are extremely uncomfortable. They also aren't adjustable in any way, meaning that I can't wear it for more than a couple of hours without pain on the back of both ears.",Canada,2020-08-24
2,Not the best,"Had good coverage, but the ear loops were too long and not adjustable so it was droopy, thus not effective and not returnable.",Canada,2020-11-19
2,If you need xxxl they would be ok,Too stretchy and sags. Too much space at sides. Poor quality straps with no adjustments.,Canada,2020-12-23
2,Mask was nice color.,The mask was a little disappointing as there is no way to insert a filter into it.,Canada,2020-12-03
2,.,The mask itself is a good fit for my face however the elastics are too big making it fit loose. As well the material itself is too thin; you can blow through it. Which makes it unsuitable for most government regulations during COVID.,Canada,2020-11-11
2,Not sure,"This was put on for the first time yesterday when it arrived, and within 60 seconds one of the ear ties/bands broke. It didn‚Äôt stand a chance however it could have been just a rogue one. I‚Äôm not saying anything against the product at all. Thanks.",Canada,2020-09-14
2,Too large!,I followed the measurements and these are way too big,Canada,2020-12-18
2,Wouldn't recommend,"Too slippery to stay in place without a nose grip. While the mask is very breathable and the fit was good, it wouldn't stay in place.",Canada,2020-09-24
2,Very thick,"The fabric used is very thick, good luck breathing through it",Canada,2020-10-07
2,Broke after 2nd use!!! Very disappointed!,Product is soft but string broke after 2nd use!!! Very disappointed since these are quite expensive.,Canada,2020-10-10
2,Bouncy,Bounces around too much whenever I move my chin or speak.,Canada,2020-09-24
2,Masks could be bigger.,"These masks could be bigger from nose to chin, while the shape does make it easier to breathe the lack of length makes the mask fit tight and a bit uncomfortable.",Canada,2020-12-10

2,Very week,"It is just a piece of material, very difficult to keep it on the face. If you wear glasses is useless.",Canada,2021-01-22
2,Too loose on the ears,After a few days of wearing them the strings on the ears loosen up and they don't hold well,Canada,2020-12-06
2,Meh,"These are very thin and stretch! After only a few wears this mask was droopy. The look is nice but for the purpose, I would not buy again.",Canada,2020-09-03

2,Waste of money,"I was excited for this mask after reading the reviews but I‚Äôm very disappointed with my purchase especially since it‚Äôs a little pricey! These masks DID NOT pass the match test, they had a weird smell (EVEN after washing and air drying), and the sizing was WRONG. I ordered a medium mask and it was not snug on my face. My glasses still kept fogging up. I even tied and knotted the ear loops to make it tighter but no luck. It slips off when I speak or move my mouth. The mask also gets a bit stuffy and feels damp for some reason. Absolutely disappointing and would NOT recommend. Waste of my money.",Canada,2020-08-24
2,Stitching going in 2/3 masks. The other one is awesome. Hence hit or a miss,"Out of 3 masks, 2 of them had threads loose right in the center. It keeps tickling my nose, causing me to either sneeze or scratch it hence defeating the entire purpose of the mask during these times. I'm now using the left over one. Item is non returnable as well. It's a hit or a miss, if you get all 3 with good stitching, the buy is worth it.",Canada,2020-11-15
2,Not so Fitting,"Material is soft but lacks fitting. Took as per the provided size chart, but still is very loose. Only advantage is reusable, but bit costly.",Canada,2020-09-20
2,Was Promising with the Size but fails the mark with the Material used and the fit.,"Poor quality Material. Washed before use, Worn at work this evening Material fraying already.

Size was promising as I need XL at my job PPE is essential and this product doesnt hold up. Size is perfect but is very loose on the face and doesnt give the feeling of Protection.",US,2021-01-25

2,HOT (in a bad way),"So hot!
Product is listed as ""Amazon's choice"" for ""100% cotton XL face mask"".
My fault for trusting Amazon search.
Made of polyester and practically unwearable because it traps the heat from your breath. I don't understand all the positive reviews. My husband also thought it was not larger than his regular sized masks. Not recommended.",US,2020-07-02
2,"Return Customer, Disappointed with Second Purchase","I first purchased this product earlier in the summer because I needed an XL face covering. The black ones I received quickly became my go-to masks. The size is right, they look good, are appropriate for office work, and the hold up well to repeated washing. And as a bonus, though they're multi-layer masks, they fold up small enough to fit in a pocket, so I always have one with me. I ordered three of the blue version this time, and this time I was disappointed. They are, if anything, softer than the black ones, but the ear pieces are less comfortable (haven't yet determined if they're shorter or just more irritating material), they fit more loosely, and perhaps most annoyingly, the middle seam is significantly off-center. This varies by mask. One is close to center, the other more clearly off, and the third way off. Not only do they look wrong, but they pull to one side, and I've caught myself more than once trying to adjust them, so the production error leads to more hand-to-mask contact. I've taken the two out of rotation. The first ones I bought were easy five-star masks. The more recent ones, unfortunately, are not.",US,2020-09-05
2,Too big,I don‚Äôt recommend getting the ‚Äúlargest size with your measurement‚Äù. My measurement was 4.5 inches and the large is way too big so the mask doesn‚Äôt fit around my nose. And no metal strip to form fit to your nose.,US,2020-07-08
2,Not CDC standard safe- Very Disappointed :(,"Masks were disappointing, so close to being great. I thought I had a large sized face, most of the masks I've bought online are always way too small. Ordered these in the XL and they were huge and baggy on my face and my boyfriend's larger face aswell. Not too much of a problem as we could just tie the ear loops smaller to make the mask tight around the face, and that seemed to work. It has good coverage from about under the eye to under your chin. While they are soft, and a good material, they are basically worthless. We did the lighter test to them (where you hold a flame infront of your mask and blow, if the flame doesn't move that means your mask is safe). We didn't even blow that hard and the flame moved around alot, meaning these masks are not very protective. They don't have a filter pocket either so I'm going to have to either make my own filter pocket or wear a surgical mask under it for the protection we need. I'm SO disappointed as the reviews all seemed great- but these masks are not CDC standard safe and was sadly a waste of my money :/",US,2020-08-01
2,Too Small,"I am a large guy but followed the direction for sizing. I was on the upper end of the ""large"" but ordered that given some reviews said the mask was loose even when properly ordered. I measured 5.5 inches and the large was supposed to be OK up to 5.75 inches. The mask did not fit, barely covered my nose and mouth. Clearly would not stay in place. the quality seems good so I ordered the XL and will return these. I will update my review after I get the larger ones.",US,2020-07-17
2,Nice 3 Ply Filtering but Poor Nose Bridge Fitament,"The mask is relatively comfortable and its 3 ply fabric prevents one from blowing out a candle to give an indication of its effectiveness; however, the area around the nose bridge leaves gaps preventing a good ""seal""; there is no metal or plastic to form around your nose bridge (the gap is a serious issue when relying upon this mask in these virus times).",US,2020-07-11
2,"Seems like a perfect fit, but actually not.","So first impressions are it fits great, good material, ear loops not too tight... but then the more I started wearing them, I realized they were kind of unusable at this point because they keep moving down when I'm talking to people and I have to readjust it over my nose CONSTANTLY. I got a size large because I feel like I have a pretty normal male face/head and that was the size recommendation but it just doesn't keep a good level of tightness on the top part so it keeps uncovering my nose. I already washed and wore them, so kinda lost out of the money. So just warning for others, I'm not sure if a smaller size will fix it, but maybe go medium if you're not a giant dude?",US,2020-08-11
2,too big- returning them,"Ordered a large according to the size chart. They were HUGE. Had to return them. Too bad, they look they'd be comfortable",US,2020-07-15
2,Way too big and got snagged on facial hair,"Before purchasing these masks we took measurements as instructed in the item's photos to help us choose the right size. We are two adults - male and female - and the measurements indicated that we would both require size ""large"". Unfortunately they were way too big for us. Not only were they baggy around the face and very loose around the ear straps, the material stuck to my husband's five o'clock shadow and pulled the mask down beneath his nose every time he opened his mouth to speak. Not good.

These masks did seem to be well-made otherwise. Light was not easily visible through them. But if a mask is falling down beneath your nose during a pandemic it's not doing its job. We ended up returning them.",US,2020-07-29
2,Not for the biggest heads,"One thing I've learned from reading all the reviews and using this mask myself is that I must have a HUGE melon. This mask is super soft and comfortable on the face, and it would be great for a guy with a full beard. But, I don't have a full beard; just a big head and big ears to match. The straps pulled my ears forward to make them stick out more. Then, every time I talked or moved my head in the slightest, the mask would slide up my face and into my eyes. So, for protecting you from viruses, it's probably a great mask. But, if you have a HUGE noggin and big ears, and you want to be able to see, this is probably not big enough for you.",US,2021-01-25
2,Very THIN!,"Three ply? Yeah, I dont think so. They are very thin! Doesnt feel like much Rona protection. They look like the cups from a teenage girls bra, lol. Not impressed.",US,2020-09-03
2,"Better masks out there, no seal to prevent glasses from clouding up","I bought this mask to replace masks I bought 6 months ago that are no longer available on AMAZON. I thought that the high ratings would ensure me that the masks would be good quality and at least equivalent to the masks I loved and bought previously.

First off they are soft and rather comfortable enough when when wearing. These are the ""normal"" size. The first design flaw I found was that when you open your mouth to talk or maybe yawn, the mask pulls down and uncovers your nose.

The biggest flaw is probably only for those who wear glasses. Because there is no metal wire seal along the top, which most masks have, your breath is directed up to your eyes, and your glasses fog up. This makes these masks absolutely un-usable for me.",US,2020-10-31
2,Size down if you purchase large,If your face is average and you purchase Large you will not be happy too large around ears and allot of coverage on face. I bought both and I found medium fits best for man and woman/coukld also fit a teenager/would purchase again in medium not large/ was satisfied with the delivery time both times,US,2020-07-25
2,"Fits great, feels good, but had a hole in it on arrival.","Not a huge deal, but the first mask I pulled out straight out of the package had a hole in it, visible from the outside which makes it look like it's old. I normally would try to straighten things out directly with the manufacturer before leaving a review, but AZ made it impossible to do so. This was my only venue to say anything? I have not seen the other 2 in this package of 3 as I gave them away to family members and long gone. As for the size and feel of it, seems to look great and a great fit so far, but I just got it today and was a little disappointed. Seems I've been getting the shaft on everything I buy online anymore and I usually don't complain and just deal with it.",US,2020-07-05
2,Not impressed,"I was getting tired of wearing those disposable masks so I thought I would try these - after reading the reviews on the comfort and sizing I thought I would order the large for my wife and XL for me. I am a big guy, 6'1 - 250lb and the XL is way to big for me - I tried my wifes Large and it fit me well but not so much for her (she's 5'6 140). So why 2 stars - while the sizing knocked it one star the fact everything you breath comes right up your nose to your eyes, there is no bendable wire to form around your nose - I can only imagine if someone wore glasses how annoying that would be. On the plus side they are soft and comfortable.",US,2020-12-03
2,Broke on second use!,"Well, we thought these would be good and we were very optimistic. That changed quick! The first wearing was fine, but after washing and going for a second wear, one of the bands has already broken! Not very happy about that at all. Maybe it's because everyone is freaked out and these are being manufactured at a record rate. Maybe they have always been this fragile! Who knows?!? Won't be getting these again.",US,2020-08-12
2,NOT WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR?,"I consider myself average size, weight etc. Thinking these might run a little small, I ordered an XL. Ok, still too small and non elastic ear straps .
In addition, no nose wire and as a result, putting one on, I could feel air coming in around the top of my nose. I would also assume, as a result, they would fog glasses? Sooo, how good of a job would it do? I sent them back.",US,2020-07-09
2,"Pointless, they have to be washed in cold water and air dry, heat is what kills the virus though..","These look and feel nice, but after reading the laundering instructions, they're pointless. The instructions say to wash in cold water and either air dry or tumble dry on the lowest setting. Well you need heat (hot water or high dryer setting) in order to kill viruses and bacteria the mask collects, that's the only way to clean it. So what are you supposed to do?",US,2020-08-12
2,"Too tight, ear bands hurt behind ears during extended wearing","Looks fine and is soft, BUT anytime I have to wear these more than a few minutes, the tiny elastic bands cut into the area behind my ears. This was very pronounced when I had to wear it 6+ hours during air travel recently. Also, it's very tight to the face and what air does get out, goes straight up into my glasses fogging them up, so just not practical to wear this all day.",US,2020-08-16
2,"Very uncomfortable, itchy mask","The first masks I got were thin and held up fairly well, but after handwashing them multiple times had started to fray.
Looked forward to the masks presuming they would be better.
Not sure why, but they slip on my nose, itch terribly and seem very claustrophobic. I feel like I can't breath as well as I did with my first thinner masks(different seller)and I can't wait to get them off my face when I leave a store.
Would NOT recomend them to anyone.",US,2021-01-01
2,Fabric doesn't breathe,This product is purported to be breathable. It isn't. Within 30 seconds of wearing the mask my glasses are steaming up and that's inside an air conditioned house. Outside they are exceptionally HOT.,US,2020-08-12
2,Keeps riding up into my eyes,"Initially these masks seemed ok. Acceptable for a 10 minute jump inside a store to pick up a few things. But when I wear them longer they quickly ride up into my eyes. The masks don't stay in place when you look down, and eventually they ride up high enough on my face to cover my eyes. Grocery shopping is an experience of constantly pulling the mask down my face to a more comfortable position so the mask top edge doesn't touch my eyeballs. I'll have to shop for replacements.",US,2020-09-13
2,Difficult to breathe,"These masks are soft & stretchy, but they are extremely uncomfortable if you have to wear them for longer than 5 minutes. It's difficult to breathe with them on and I became dizzy, lightheaded & nauseous whilst grocery shopping because I was breathing & re-breathing the same air. Unfortunately, I ordered 2 packs and won't be opening/using the 2nd because they're that unpleasant to use. (Can't return it, either, because I would have to return both, but can't return one of the packages because I opened it)",US,2020-08-07
2,WRONG SIZE,"Looks like a nice produce, but when a ""medium"" is ordered and you receive an ""XL"", it's not any good.
Quanity and Size has become a real issue with Amazon lately. Are we getting too big too fast?
Thanks, Walt",US,2020-07-03
2,"Made in Vietnam (not U.S. made, which I specified in search engine)","*Very tight (left to right), elastic pulls ears forward. (I did measure top to bottom, as specified [*I suggest measurement for left to right, as well: use cloth tape measure, start middle of one ear (include draping it over surface of contour of user's face), to middle of other ear]. Not all faces are narrow, some are wider.
*Not sure if it's 3-ply, fabric is thinner than expected.
*Holding up to light, can see a pattern of holes), making me question- will it block fine particulates of Covid?
*When I did a product search for U.S.-made Covid masks ""Mayfair Brands"" came up, but product arrived and says clearly, Made in Vietnam.
(Amazon isn't forthcoming & doesn't display origin of Vendors, ie., last year, Mar.2020, I ordered elastic to sew masks (it was on backorder from Europe)",US,2021-01-28
2,Cannot add a filter. Seam down the middle. Thin material.,"Came within one day from ordering. Has a seam down the middle and no opening for filter. Even if I cut the inside sides I can't put a filter in because of the seam down the middle. Very thin material, so I don't feel safe wearing these masks.",US,2020-09-03
2,A little better quality needed.,"I followed the instructions on the package which stated to wash them first in cold water prior to using them. I did this and let them air dry. I then took one and looped it over 1 ear but when placing over my other ear the loop broke away from the mask, making it useless. These masks are not the cheap kind so I expected more from them. I will be returning them to Amazon.",US,2020-11-14
2,Hurting my ear,"This mask is not comfortable after wearing 3-4 hours. It starts to hurt my ears. The ear loop is like the one you get on cheap blue mask.
Not recommended if your going to wear all day.",US,2020-12-28
2,Not effective - no nose seal/ formable strip,"You can see light pin points through these.
Nose area does not seal- there is no metal strip to bend around your nose.
Glasses fog because of the gap around the nose.
Really not a good choice.",US,2020-10-04
2,"Don‚Äôt waste money, Get the real deal from a long standing company","Don‚Äôt waste your money on something that is going to shrink and that you‚Äôll be pulling up to keep your nose covered all day and night too.

2,Skip these - try something else,"They are super comfy. BUT, they are cheaply made. No nose part. When I breathe in - the mask sucks in making it hard to wear. I have to pull it down more than I care to, to catch my breath. YES - I know the masks are supposed to be worn tight - that isn't the issue. Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend these to anyone because of that one issue.",US,2020-12-14
2,Would not protect anyone,These were soft and breathable... too breathable! It is mesh like and you can blow straight through them. I blew candles out easily. This is not a good mask for protection from a virus. Also I measured my face and ordered per their size chart and it was huge. They did refund me with no issues so that was nice. Good customer service.,US,2020-12-31
2,Not kid size,"Ok, but definitely not kids size. The small fit me perfectly, but not my 12yr old who needed the masks.",US,2020-07-21
2,very hard to breathe through and too small,"I have a big face and a hard time breathing through masks, was hoping these would help with all the positive reviews, but it was a complete bust. These masks are made of synthetic materials and are very thick, making them very difficult to breathe through. They also aren't much bigger than regular size masks. Completely useless.",US,2020-09-19
2,"Soft, but issues with ear straps","Not all that breathable, but I suppose thats okay given the reason we are wearing them. My biggest complaint is definitely the ear straps. They are thin elastic that is comfortable, but loading its stretch after a few times wearing one of these. So not very durable and will to order something to replace these already.",US,2020-12-18
2,Not very effective for a few reasons...,"The mask's material seems durable and is comfortable/light enough to wear for extended periods of time. However, there is no malleable piece of metal near the nose to provide a secure fit and the large sizing leaves the mask loose on my face (it wont fit my wife's face at all). The ear straps are not adjustable, either. My wife purchased a different 3-mask set from American Eagle for significantly less money and each mask is adjustable, providing a snug fit around the nose. These masks will only work for those who need larger sizes; I'm 6'1"" and incorrectly assumed the large sizing would be fine for me. I'd recommend finding masks that are adjustable and more form fitting.",US,2020-08-13
2,Beware Size!,"I purchased the smallest size of this mask for my kids ages 4 to 12. The bands that go aroudn the ears barely fit tight enough around my 12 year old. My other kids cannot wear these as they do not stay on. The cloth is nice, and they seem decent in quality, but the size is compeltely inaccurate due to the ear bands.",US,2020-08-21
2,Earbands too tight and not made well! Hurts back of my ears,Was hoping I was going to like these. I got the large. I'm average size adult male. The face mask itself is good nice and soft material. Good to breath in. Then there is the problem with the earbands. There too tight and not made out of soft material. Kinda like a rough hair tie. These would have been good if earbands were adjustable or loose and made out of soft material. I thought about maybe if I went xl size might not be as tight. But still not happy with the earbands how there made hurts back of my ears. Going in the trash as I will find better ones.,US,2020-09-20
2,No metal over the bridge of your nose,"You need that little piece of bendable metal over the bridge of the nose to keep a mask in place and so you can squeeze the mask against your face to keep your glasses from fogging. These don't have that. I have found they are okay for a short visit to a store for COVID protection, but they slip off the face when worn for longer periods of time. Otherwise they are comfortable and thick, so no complaints. It's just that there are plenty of cheap options with the metal piece, don't bother with these.",US,2020-12-24
2,They are going back,"Since this item is shown with the additional filters one would assume they work together. Not so.
Ordered both ....... the masks arrived today ....... there is no sleeve to insert the filters.
Why would they be shown together on both ads .... the mask and filter pages recommend buying together.",US,2020-07-29
2,Far too small for an adult,"As an adult with an average-sized, perhaps even smaller-leaning, head, these are WAY too small. The mask itself is a bit too small, but the strings that attach behind your ears are so tiny they will barely fit over even when stretched. Because of how tight it is with these tiny strings, it's very uncomfortable to wear. I will not be using these masks and I regret my purchase.",US,2020-11-10
2,Do not wash it...,"I washed mine using warm soap and water and now it doesn't fit any longer, it shrank to the point where I have to really pull hard to get it to go around my ears. They are comfortable and stylish until you wash them, then useless, at least for me.",US,2021-01-12
2,Wonky fit,"The large size was too big for me (and my face is average size). I had to knot the ear loops to adapt the fit, which still hasn‚Äôt completely resolved the issue (now the knots dig into my ear/head). The biggest problem for me is the lack of a nose grip; I can‚Äôt wear my glasses as they completely fog up. Now I have to invest in more masks and they‚Äôre not cheap. I purchased this product based on the great reviews. Very disappointed.",US,2021-01-14
2,Strap broke on first mask I put on,"The masks are nice and comfortable, but the very first mask that I pulled out and put on, the right ear strap broke. And it wasn't like I wasn't stretching it far or anything, just putting it on. But it was instantly useless. The other two seem great, but what a bummer to pay for three and really only get two. I hope others have better luck.",US,2020-12-30
2,Very thin offers little to no protection from virus.,"For covid 19 protection these are useless, they can‚Äôt even pass the candle test. WAY too much air passes through these. Other than that the fit is great and they‚Äôre a very soft material. I‚Äôll put these aside for outside grass cutting duty but forget it for anything else.",US,2020-09-26
2,Doesn't seal around the nose,"It is comfortable and seems to be well made, but it does not seal around my nose. I end up with fog in my glasses and I'm not sure it fulfills its purpose with so much air flow around the nose. I'm sure I will be able to fix it by running a thin piece of wire in the trim so I can shape it, but it would have been nice if it were fully functional as is.",US,2020-10-21
2,Too big for kids,"Definitely didn't fit my 6 year old, but fits my adult face. Two stars because I will wear them, but annoyed that I have to keep searching for masks that fit my kid.",US,2020-08-07
2,Too big for a small adult face. Definitely not ‚Äúyouth size‚Äù.,"I ordered the youth/adult small masks, but they were entirely too big for my face. I gave them to my fianc√© and they fit him fine.",US,2020-07-19
2,Ineffective against Covid due to gaps around the nose!,"There is only one reason why I gave this mask a 2-star rating. That is it doesn't block the air, when you breath, from coming in from both sides of your nose, due to the gaps. The gaps are there because the mask doesn't have a flexible metal strip to clamp down on your nose. It was a well made mask, comfortable, and covered my face very well, except for this one design flaw. If the manufacturer adds a metal strip to future masks, then I'd give it a 5-star rating. Until then, I get better protection from my disposable face mask.",US,2021-01-29
2,Doesn't fit my nose snugly,"Doesn't provide much protection along the sides of my nose, even though the mask fits snugly enough around the mouth‚Äîit needs a wire nose-piece so that the fabric doesn't leave gaps between the nose and the cheeks. It is reasonably comfortable, although adjustable ear loops would be helpful because the tension is a bit too high for me. Size Large‚Äîany smaller would be too tight. I would've rather had one mask that fit well than three that don't...would be good if company sold these as individual masks to avoid waste (I didn't see them available in singles).",US,2020-09-02
2,Ear loops aren‚Äôt for childrens sizes,I ordered these for my son who‚Äôs 9. 1 came with one of the ear loops unattached. Of course I couldn‚Äôt just return 1 but needed the other 2 for school so that was a small loss. The cloth is ‚Äúchild sized‚Äù but the ear loops are big on him still for being a size small so I had to tie little knots so they would fit better but that‚Äôs ok they‚Äôll make due until I receive different ones.,US,2020-09-07
2,Frustrated by Shrinkage and Size Issues,"Two sizes were purchased by my wife. The large was too loose even after washing and the medium shrunk up in length/height after trying it on and washing before wearing. (Of course, they are both too small for me.) Sadly, we wasted our money on two different orders/sizes. My wife is frustrated, to say the least as it is back to the search for a mask that fits. I don't know if these would protect anyway. They're pretty thin feeling and I don't feel three fabrics.",US,2020-11-14
2,Disappointed,Was excited to receive but was sorely disappointed. The adult size masks are VERY large which means there is no stretch as claimed because they are way to big! I do not have a small face either. Probably only useful for wearing over an N95.,US,2020-07-26
2,Ears hurt,"I really liked it initially but when I use it after several washes, my ear started to hurt. The elastic of ear loop may shrunk, but I no longer able to use. The texture is soft, shape is ideal but I cannot wear anymore.",US,2020-12-11
2,Not XL.,"I purchased these for my husband. He needs a larger size face mask. I was excited when I saw the description. Once I received the order, I realized they aren‚Äôt much larger than the regular size I already had.",US,2020-06-30
2,Deteriorated when washed!,"Loved these masks and thought they were protecting me but it turns out after a few machine washes, over the course of only a few weeks, these masks fail the match test! I don‚Äôt know if washing the masks deteriorated the functionality of the masks but I was very disappointed. When I first bought the masks I tried the match test, it worked and felt very safe but now not so much, they feel thinner as well.",US,2020-10-19
2,WAY too big,"These are soft, comfortable, and breathable. However, they are WAY too big for my average sized 12 year old and 10 year old. They fit me, and I am a full-grown adult. Not sure how these are marketed for kids ages 4-10. Bummer.",US,2020-07-20
2,Won‚Äôt stay over nose. I would not buy again.,"Bought for my 5 year old. It‚Äôs so soft that it won‚Äôt stay up. Because it has no nose wire or hold up mechanism, it falls down easily. I‚Äôve tried tightening ear loops and even doubling up with a disposable mask with nose wire and the disposable stays up, this one falls down. I can‚Äôt use to send him to school anymore because of this. For your product improvement - include a nose wire inside fabric, ear loop adjusters and possibly stronger fabric to ensure a better fit for kids.",US,2021-01-28
2,Like a wool sock over your face,So soft and comfortable BUT absolutely unbreathable. I'm only able to wear these for a VERY short time before the lack of air makes me feel like I'm going to hyperventilate. Maybe in winter they will be better.,US,2020-12-08
2,No nose wire and quite warm,I like the fit but there is no nose wire therefore my glasses fog up...alot. The material has polyester which I find rather warm. After a while of wearing my mask it feels damp.,US,2021-01-14
2,Great comfort but not sure if COVID-safe,"I bought these masks before traveling across a few states over a long drive. While these masks are really soft and comfortable, there's a gap between the mask and my nose trench that makes them loose and I am not sure if they are as protective.",US,2020-08-02
2,Way Too Thin For Covid Protection,These mask are really comfortable and fit well but they are waaaay too thin to be of any significant protection against germs. Even with 3 layers. I am able to feel my breath if I blow through the fabric. I know the description says non surgical but since it seemed such a popular purchase on Amazon I figure many people are buying it for protection against the virus. Too bad it doesn't have a pocket for some kind of filter.,US,2020-09-06
2,Not impressed,I am not impressed with this product. I bought a medium size and it is too big. The directions stated to wash in cold water and let it air dry. I don‚Äôt understand how you can sterilize the mask in cold water. I washed it in warm water and put it in the dryer under low heat. It shrank a little which was good but it still is not snug on my face. I will be washing it in hot water and see what happens.,US,2021-01-23
2,Three ply is too thick,They are large so they fit but if you want to breathe do not put it on it is too thick to breathe through. I am wearing a mask because I have to but I also have to breathe the three ply is too thick. I will order something else. It‚Äôs my fault,US,2020-07-29
2,BEWARE OF SIZE,"The product was super comfortable and the material seemed to be of high quality. However, the size was far too small. I order the large one, and it barely covered my chin. I'm an average sized male with an average sized head, I would recommend to get the extra large one. Tis, a shame that it did not fit.",US,2020-07-17
2,Huge,"I have a small face - however these are huge - way too big. Also, I was expecting them to have a slit to insert a filter for more protection - it does not have this. No wire in the nose - so it gapes too much for me to wear",US,2020-08-06
2,Save your money!,"Even though the size was supposed to be correct, it was too small to even cover my nose. They slipped off every time I spoke! Total junk. I trashed them!",US,2020-11-02
2,Straps are tearing in the first hour of wearing!,"Great fit, material of the mask is awesome, but the elastic is nill. I just arrived at work and the elastic is already pulling apart from the mask. I wish they would of put more attention into the durability of this. I wouldn't think that anybody is going to get any kind of longevity out of these.",US,2020-08-03
2,Broke strap after a couple weeks,"A little disappointed as after only a couple weeks one of the ear straps broke. Comfortable bought not worth the cost if all three break after minimal use, as I don‚Äôt go about much.",US,2020-08-16
2,"No nose clip, to keep it tight","The mask is very comfortable, I just wish there was a nose ring that helps it keep tight. I feel like it wouldn't work against covid even though I know mask are not 100% safety, it just feels to thin and feel like the virus can pass through",US,2021-01-07
2,Reorder was different from the original product.,"I‚Äôm very confused about my 2 orders for these. The masks sent were not the same. The first order I received was great, it has a perfect shape for the kids. The 2nd order was a different mask with a white backing and is not the best fitter. I‚Äôm really disappointed that I spent the money on the second order and it ended up being an inferior product.
They were supposed to be the same!",US,2020-12-16
2,Not suited as a covid-19 mask.,I would not purchase this if you're looking for a mask to protect you from Covid. While it is comfortable there's no wire to mold the top of the mask to your nose to ensure a tight seal. And overall the mask is somehow both too big and too small all at once.,US,2020-11-11
2,Not good,This mask is ok. It doesnt have the adjustable meral piece that goes above the nose. Fabric is soft but feels too thick.,US,2021-01-02
2,Too hot for summer & sizing chart is off,"The sizing chart and instruction is wrong. I followed it and purchased the XL size which was too large. If you‚Äôre on the upper end of the scale go down, not up. The mask is way too hot and itchy to wear in summer weather. I could not wear this mask on warm to hot days. Would sweat too much under this mask. May be good in winter weather. Lastly, don‚Äôt wash in washing machine with other clothes. Color bled on to other clothes.",US,2020-08-22
2,I have been cheated,I was supposed to get two in the package I only received one (3 in pouch) I need the other three as I paid for them,US,2020-10-30
2,Didn't Last,"I work in a pharmacy so I talk a lot (stretching the mask), but the mask is also really important. After 2-3 days of use they began falling down my face making them nothing more than a liability. Basically $20 for a week of use. Not at all worth it. These are okay for trips to the store with minimal talking, but not anything else.",US,2020-10-29
2,Not So Great,"I'm 6 ft. and weigh 200 lb. I ordered a large, but apparently I have a big head because it pulls my ears out and is uncomfortable. Also, it is less breathable than the common paper masks.",US,2020-11-26
2,Way to big...,"If you have a head Big as Texas, you might like the mask. I have a big head and it still fell off. The mask must be made for animals....a cow, pig, moose, not a human...",US,2020-10-10
2,If you like foggy glasses,Yes lightweight but without the metal piece the mask does not contour to your nose allowing heat to escape and fogging glasses. Useless to me since my glasses constantly fog.,US,2020-09-15
2,Not good for physical activity/working out,I bought this to use in the gym but it did not workout. If you plan on doing any physical activity the mask will get suck into your airway when breathing heavy....I guess it‚Äôs good for an everyday use though,US,2020-10-26
2,Fair,A little flimsy,US,2020-07-31
2,Its not that big fellas!,"Mask feels short and like the ear loops are pulling my ears in. Good softness and material, but I need a mask that will fit me. Good mask for small heads, but not for big people.",US,2020-08-31
2,Disappointed,Doesn't fit tightly over the nose. Large size is smaller than expected. Would not feel safe in it.,US,2020-07-10
2,Do not buy if you wear glasses,"Masks will not work with glasses, the material is too loose and the glasses fog badly. I've tried several types of masks and these were the worst.",US,2020-08-21
2,Ear loops too big for my 7 year old,Purchased the small/kids size. Sizing runs very big. Ear loops were waaaaay too big for my 7 year old.,US,2020-09-06
2,They have a bad smell,Ordered 2 packages of these masks. They all have a strange smell. It took a lot of Febreze to get rid of it. Ugh.,US,2020-09-06
2,3 Ply?,"I don't see that they are three layers, and they are overpriced for the quality. Comfortable enough for extended wear.",US,2020-07-12
2,Mask is not good for exercising,"This mask is not good for the gym if you are on a treadmill. It is polyester and cotton. It gets wet after you work out. I don't find it that comfortable. It is okay if you go into a store or restaurant, but for activities indoor and outdoor I don't recommend it.",US,2020-10-19
2,Did not work for my husband.,"My husband needed a bigger size and these are right size for him, but the mask kept coming up when he talked.",US,2020-07-30
2,Not what I expected,These mask are pretty small. I haven't seen any mask that are able to fit heavy set people like myself.,US,2020-09-03
2,Fogged Glasses,"If you wear glasses, as I do, I would suggest looking for another mask option. While they are comfortable and breathable, the lack of structure around the nose area leads to constantly fogged glasses.",US,2020-12-11
2,Too big for my 3 year old.,"Too big for my 3 year old. I ordered appropriate size, so disappointed as I really needed it to fit my son.",US,2020-07-07
2,Broken ear loop.,"- i purchased these masks on 8/30. When i opened the bag, the ear loop of one mask was already broken (see picture attached). Clearly, the manufacturer does not have the minimum quality control/inspection.

- I rarely put negative comments on any products. I am so disappointed by the quality this time.",US,2020-09-05
2,go smaller with the size,"Based on their sizing, I ordered large, and it fit just fine in the beginning; however, after a couple uses, they stretched a bit and now they keep falling off my nose. Everything else is great though. So if you're gonna order, I'd say go a size smaller than what they suggest",US,2020-09-27
2,One snapped the second I tried to put it on,I just opened the box and tried one on for the first time just to see if they fit my face. Then one of the ear loops snapped as soon as I tried to put it on. I'm down one mask now. Overall though they are pretty comfortable and fit really well on my face.,US,2020-12-11
2,Not very breathable facemasks,"These facemasks are loose, baggy and have no nose bridge wire to stop fogging on the eyeglasses. Soft materials but not very breathable.",US,2020-08-11
2,You can see right through these,"The fabric stitch is so thin, if you hold is up to the light you can see right through them",US,2021-02-02
2,Check the quantity,"Only got 2 not 3. A bit sad. Love them, third time ordering.",US,2021-01-21
2,"Will fog up your glasses, are very large","These masks were very large and do not provide a good fit, especially if you have glasses. I feel like I am sucking in the material every time I try to talk in these. My co-worker gave me a different mask that fits much better. Can not attest to their durability as I try to wear this particular mask as little as possible (only when others are in the wash)",US,2020-08-26
2,Not the best,Really loose around nose and face. Any cough or sneeze is going up and out. Comfortable and sized correctly.,US,2021-01-23
2,Slips below nose,"I bought these for my 8 and 10 year old. The mask is soft but it kept slipping down below their nose when they would talk in school. I was so happy to finally find a mask that fit my kids. Needless to say, I was disappointed. üòû",US,2020-11-04
2,Elastic straps,"The fabric part is the perfect size its soft and breathable but it seems like they can't get the strap size to all match, all of my masks in the 3 pack had different lengths and can only use 1 out of the 3 masks bc of it.",US,2020-12-05
2,Not for people who wear glasses,"Without a nose wire, this is impossible to wear with glasses. They just end up fogged up all the time.",US,2020-12-17
2,It's not as large as XL would suffest.,I am very disappointed in the XL size for men. When I open my to breath it slips down a bit on my nose. Maybe this would work for normal size men. It seems soft and decent quality otherwise.,US,2020-07-24
2,It‚Äôs all about the size.,"Seems like decent quality however order a size larger than you need if you use the sellers measurement tool. Unfortunately these do not fit me and I hate doing returns, I‚Äôll have to give them to a small adult or child.",US,2020-08-20
2,Does not stay in place,Does not stay in place despite the multiple size options.,US,2020-11-08
2,Do not fit,These are terrible. I went by the measurements and they do not fit at all.,US,2020-07-23
2,I‚Äôm confused,"It‚Äôs all good till I washed it, after wash it seems like it‚Äôs not water resistant anymore.",US,2020-10-12
2,As advertise the Face masks are made of cotton and the elastic is Thin,The masks are made out of cotton. It has two layers. The elastic is thin.,US,2020-07-24
2,Too big,"Followed the measurement guidelines, but large was still way to big for my face (adult female). Not usable. Husband will try them out. Mask does not tuck under the chin as much as it should for secure fit and good coverage.",US,2020-09-29
2,Hot,"Fit ok, but they don't breathe very well and it gets hot.",US,2020-08-29
2,Ok. But needs work.,Purchase the product because we have to wear masks. So i figured why not try this one. Got the package and opened it up and try one on to see the fitment and then the strap broke. The straps need to be one full piece and stitched all the way. From one side to the other. Instead of one stich on the ends. But over all soft product.,US,2020-07-21
2,"Looked like quality masks, but small","Didn‚Äôt open sealed package. Masks appeared and felt light weight, nice material, good quality ear straps. Good for youth and maybe a petite woman. Too small for husband. Returned.",US,2020-12-17
2,Non comfortable,Fogged up my glasses.,US,2020-12-16

2,Not a good fit.,Did not like the way it was presented.,US,2020-09-05
2,Would be perfect.... if it was adjustable.,These masks would be 5 stars all day if the war loops were adjustable. They are made of thin round elastic that slightly cuts into the back of the ears making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.,US,2020-10-16
2,this mask keeps falling off the nose,i don't use this product,US,2020-12-06
2,Will not purchase again.,Mask came damaged.,US,2021-02-02
2,Didn't meet expectations.,Too large and didn't fit comfortably.,US,2020-10-06
2,Ok but sloppy sewing and very hot,"Ok mask for a pinch. Very hot with the 3-ply mask and some of the seems are coming apart already after 1 washing. Not very breathable, especially for the summer weather. Recommend a 2-ply mask for use if you are going to wear your mask for any length of time (over 15 minutes).",US,2020-08-16
2,Sizing inconsistent,I‚Äôve purchased quite a few and my last batch of 9 orders came in drastically different sizes. I cannot return them as they were purchased for HTV project.,US,2020-10-22
2,Not the greatest,Not very satisfied with purchase.,US,2020-10-01
2,Not breathable at all!,This feels like you have 3 layers of underwear on your face. Within 5 minutes there was sweat dripping and it because very hot to wear.,US,2020-08-03
2,3 pack came with only 2,"Great mask, very comfortable but paid and ordered the 3 pack but instead got only 2 mask on the package. Otherwise would give 5 stars",US,2020-08-25
2,Paint run off,Washed it and paint ran off.,US,2020-07-13
2,Bad fit,The product lookd great and is of quality materials but the ear straps are too long so it hangs on a child‚Äôs face. They should be shorter to ensure an accurate fit.,US,2020-08-04
2,This product not for those who wear glasses,I should have done my homework. Their is not a reinforced area across the bridge of the nose to seal the area. With every exhale you get a momentary fogging of your glasses. The cheap disposal masks have this. Obviously disappointed. The masks are now in my pile of last resort items.,US,2020-09-30
2,Size does not meet description.,Package marked XL but masks are not marked with size. They are more like Medium in size not XL They do not cover a mans face at nose and chin. Should have ordered Made in USA but this was a recommended product by Amazon. I see they are made in Vietnam. Not worth the price for skimpy cotton masks.,US,2020-09-07
2,Potential Fit Issue,Used fit suggestions manufacturer provided and the masks are very loose and fall off my nose.,US,2020-07-28
2,"Comfortable, but dont last long","Comfortable, but the ear loops break with little use",US,2020-11-07

2,Notnfor thosenof who wear glasses!,I wear glasses and with this mask my glasses fog up worse than with any other mask. Don't recommend for glass wearersüò£,US,2020-10-02
2,Its comfortable... but,"It is comfortable mask, but it collects a lot of lint when washing them. It also itches your mouth area a lot because of the lints, which is a bit annoying when using it. Otherwise, it does the job.",US,2020-10-01
2,Too big,I ordered these for my 3 1/2 year old and they are way too big. They are also too loose for my 6 year old. It can actually fit pretty comfortably on my face. Theybalso had a weird chemical smell to them.,US,2020-07-29
2,Do not waste your money.,Tiny and not worth the $$s.,US,2020-08-30
2,Not breathable,The mask itself is well constructed but the fabric is not breathable and hot. All three layers are 65% polyester which shouldn‚Äôt be used on a face mask. The mask was so hot I could not wear it all day at work and had to change to a disposable mask.,US,2020-11-10
2,Not secure fit,"I really wanted to be happy with these, but they really don‚Äôt offer much protection. I was going to try to modify, but think I‚Äôll probably just end up returning these.",US,2020-07-19

2,"Poor Quality, Ear Straps broke immediately","One of the three masks broke immediately at the ear loop as soon as I went to put it on. Effectively paid for two masks, not three. Now nervous the other two will do the same. Overall poor quality.",US,2021-01-25
2,Don't stay up above nose,Not so great. They don't stay up. I have tried both sides. Ordered large size 190 lb 5-11.,US,2020-10-12
2,Quality was poor,The first one I started to use the earpiece broke off and then as I went to the other one and I found it to smell badly so I put them all back in the package I found them to be rather cheap especially the ear holders,US,2020-12-12
2,Sweat box with straps,These things are 3 layers thick. Not easily breathable at all. You start sweating inside as soon as you put it on. I‚Äôm taking a razor blade and cutting the inner two layers out to see if that makes these things breathe easier.,US,2020-09-17
2,"Didn't fit, too big!","I had high hopes due to how popular these are, and after reading the reviews and comments ordered size large. Nope! Do NOT order size large if you have a normal/average sized adult face. Falls right off. Wasted my money.",US,2020-09-15

2,Very Thin Material,These masks are not as good as the disposable surgical masks. Lots of tiny holes and better than nothing. I cannot see how this would provide much protection to anyone.,US,2020-12-12
2,Comfort but not durable,Husband said he loved the way they feel on his face when he is working all day. But disappointed after only 2 wears one of them started to tear at the seams. That is why only 2 stars.,US,2021-01-02

2,The size is most important. If it doesn‚Äôt fit they are of no use.,I received three different sizes. The masked would be fine except only one fits.

2,Huge size Inconsistencies bad quality control,"I deleted my old review and had to knock this product down to two stars. I've bought 2 bags if youth/m for myself and 2 bags of large for my husband different times over the period of a few months. One bag of large only had one working mask because the ear elastics on the others were broken, the second bag of large came with all ear elastics intact but the masks were smaller than our first pack of large.... moving on to youth/Medium: the first bag of medium fit well on me and there were no issue, the second pack of mediums came with one medium and the other two were the same size as our larges. Order at your own risk. The quality control and sizing is clearly extremely inconsistent.",US,2020-07-29
2,Sits funny,"These don't fit youth, I am an adult female and they don't even fit me that well. They are made at an odd angle that if you talk or move it instantly slide off your nose.

In my picture, it shows where it was to default to sit at, below the nose which makes it not effective.

I wanted this for my son, but it is too big for him. And these sit funny so probably won't use",US,2020-07-01
2,Bonne qualit√© mais trop grand,"Ils sont confortables et on l‚Äôair d‚Äô√™tre de bonne fabrication, mais ils sont trop grands, il faut constamment le remettre a sa place. Dommage.",France,2021-01-19
2,"Good comfortable XL fit, everything else is bad","The XL size gets Five stars for fit, but everything else is a one star. I‚Äôm a big guy. 6‚Äô3‚Äù tall, 250 pounds and many masks are simply too small to comfortably cover my mouth and nose at the same time. These do that well, BUT after that everything else goes downhill. I‚Äôm also a retired emergency physician, and wore medical masks frequently for many years. These masks do not have the metal strip at the top that seals around your nose, which causes fogging of my glasses, and more importantly leaves a gap where virus contaminated air can bypass the mask. Plus other reviewers have said they can breathe easily though this mask, and that‚Äôs true. But that makes me wonder how good of a virus barrier these are. If the air goes through too easily, the the virus might too. I won‚Äôt be wearing these masks.",US,2020-12-11
2,Difficult to speak with theses on.,"Great mask, great price! You can actually breathe through them. They are light weight and cover your nose and mouth well. I have a small face, but my husband and son are big guys and the mask stretch to fit them. Straps seem to be very secure on these mask.
EDIT: after wearing one of theses mask for about 30 mins. I discovered it is very difficult to speak with them on and because they don‚Äôt have the wire nose piece It moves constantly when you speak. I would recommend purchasing a mass with a nose wire.",US,2020-06-22
2,"Poorly made, ear loops broke","I was very happy to get these masks based on the wonderful reviews. When i opened them there was a bit of a smell, but that was fine since the instructions were to wash first. I hand washed one mask and after letting it dry let it become my car mask. It lived happily in may car hanging from the turnsignal. I would put it on to go into stores and then remove it. Prior to this I was using a good disposable (one of the ones made prior to corona that dont hurt my ears and smash my nose). Those would last for a very long time until I would finally become disgusted with them. This barely lasted.

I was heading into Costco a few days ago and just putting the mask on I had the ear loop dethatch from the mask. It was an uncomfortable experience having to jerry rig this to stay on my face and keep me in compliance. This had never been machine washed or mistreated or abused. It had only been used by me and didnt log a lot of wearing cycles or hours. I am grateful for Amazon's generous return policy.",US,2020-11-11
2,Disappointed,"I searched for an hour reading reviews before finally settling on this mask. We did the measurements and ordered a set in size large for my husband and a medium/youth for myself. At first I was very impressed. The mask was soft, comfortable and I could actually breathe, but I have a small, narrow face and the size was just still too large for me. So before opening the package for my husband, I had him try on the smaller size. Fit quite well, but I thought looked a tad too small. I opened the large package and the results: both sizes fit the same and somehow I actually got the
6 masks intermingled and needed to sort them appropriately. There were NO size markings and lying them together I saw they were all about the same size! No difference at all! What a waste of time. Returned them and now am hesitant to buy another brand. Really frustrating.",US,2021-01-08
2,Shame on me.... Inner Layer NanoFine Cotton Blend?!?,"I can see clearly now as the dropplets come...I'm embarrassed...I read the ""Nanofine"" in the description, and all the glowing reviews, without doing my research into ""nanofine"", well, its nothing more than a ""folded bandana"". I really desperately wanted to love these as a replacement for the wasteful surgical masks, but, I CAN SEE LIGHT THRU THESE ?!?!? I admit, I haven't washed them yet, so they may tighten-up, but ATM, I am very skeptical of trusting them to protect my family. Should have just bought some local, from neighbors who also incorporate PM2.5 pockets...Ima soooo ashamed....",US,2020-07-17
2,Inconsistent sizes!,"These are ok. I ordered a large for my husbands rugged face. However, the ones that came are not the same sizes. I'm not too upset because I can use the smaller ones. But it would have been nice to get what I ordered.",US,2020-07-14
2,The XL isn't big enough for my husband's head,"I had purchased Large for me and XL for my husband. Others folks descriptions made me believe that they would fit a large head with a beard. My husband couldn't stretch the loops far enough to get them over his ears. When I compare the two sizes, they were basically the same size. The fabric masks make it a little too difficult to breathe while wearing. The paper masks are much easier to breathe through. I will probably use these only when I plan very short term use, like 10 minutes or less. Am going to order a box of 50 papers masks.",US,2020-11-30
2,What's with the blue?,"I have ordered the black version of these twice and have been very satisfied. Then I decided to try the blue in the exact same size large. They were much bigger, baggy and oddly cut. They round out in the front too far making you look like you have on a horse feeder bag. While I realize wearing a mask isn't really a fashion statement, they should fit properly and look decent. My other ones(black) were not cut in the same way. They are rounded in the front as well but not as much proving a nice contour fit. What's up with that? My advice is: Stick with the black. The blue ones are weird and big. I returned them.",US,2021-01-23
2,Breathable but so is gauze,"Measured against my wife's homemade, 3 ply cotton with nose clip these just aren't competitive. I thought that homemade might not be good enough so bought these since they were very highly rated - as we learn this doesn't always mean that much given that most people will rate anything that doesn't fall apart immediately as at least four stars.
In any case, these masks are two ply without a pocket to fit a filter. Two ply makes them very breathable but then so is gauze. The knit makes them comfortable. However, they are hot and slip down since there is no nose clip and they fog up glasses as well. I threw them in my glove compartment in case I forget my homemade mask.",US,2020-09-09
2,Not protective,"I blew a candle out wearing this mask; while washing it, water quickly seeped & went through it; no nose wire to keep potential airborne virus out; sewn right down the middle, so no PM2.5 filter can be inserted and no full face filter can be worn comfortably, paper-thin double-ply stretchy fabrics, not 100% cotton. I should have searched the reviews carefully for descriptive info, if you want CDC reco‚Äôd strength & protection more than super soft and cute fashion, these are not for you.",US,2021-01-01
2,They changed the sizing - WAY too big - XXXL?,"Update: after ordering these three times and loving them they have totally changed the sizing! They are now WAY too big for my face and don‚Äôt fit at all. I‚Äôm not sure why they would do this after months and months of offering a consistently good product. I won‚Äôt order them again.

Old review:
I‚Äôve tried 11 different brands and this is the coolest feeling and largest fit I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù 250 and these fit great (there‚Äôs still room to stretch for bigger faces). The two layers are thick but somehow not hot - every other mask made my face sweat. I ordered another pack right away.",US,2020-07-24
2,Soft but for me MUCH TO HOT for all day wear,"I have to wear a mask all dat at work. These are very soft which I love and all black so my makeup transfer is hidden BUT they hold A LOT of heat. I had to switch to a different mask 1/2 way through the day.
I‚Äôd say great for short runs to grocery store but for all day was not good for me at all. They literally TRAP heat. :( sad.",US,2020-12-09
2,TERRIBLE for exercise. Don't get these if you sweat!,"I'm surprised by all the great reviews for these. They seem adequate for indoor non-exercise use, but they're terrible for exercise. The material gets sucked into my mouth when I breathe hard. The entire mask gets saturated with sweat and becomes so heavy that the elastic can't hold it up properly, and it slips off my face. Even if I stop and wring it out, or rotate through all three masks in a single class, it's wet, uncomfortable, and won't stay in place. I ordered Medium and received Large, but my I don't think a smaller size would help. It's just not the right material, weave, or structure for handling heavy breathing or sweat.",US,2020-10-06
2,Not so good for eyeglass wearers,"The only problem I have with this mask is that it does not fit snugly at the nose. Since I wear eyeglasses, my lenses are always fogging up making these masks more uncomfortable to wear than other masks that I own.",US,2020-07-22
2,Too Small,"I bought the ""XL"" size masks, and the size is a joke. It is more child size, and won't even fit over my nose and chin at the same time. Totally worthless for an adult male.

EDIT: The seller gave me a full refund when they found out I wasn't happy with their product so I have to thank them for good customer service.",US,2020-07-04
2,Slides down and off even after following measurement guide!,"I followed the size guidance a measure from the middle of of eye cavity to the bottom of my chin but the large size, which should have worked with an extra 1/2 inch to spare was just too small and uncomfortable to wear as it constantly slide down. My guess is the slightly larger XL might have worked better. Sadly, they are not returnable. I have just order another brand where large appears to be larger and contains an adjustable nose clip.",US,2021-01-10
2,"Comfortable, but stitching separation after a couple washes","I ordered these on November 20th, 2020. I clean them by adding to a light load in washing machine with clothes. I do not put them in the dryer. After a couple light washes, the stitching on one of the masks is starting to separate.
For the cost, these should be more durable. They are comfortable and breathe well, but I'm disappointed in build quality.
I do not recommend.",US,2020-12-03
2,Read the product descrption closely!,"The fit is perfect for me. I'm impressed with the way they fit over my nose and the lack of a gap on the sides.
When they say you should wash the masks before wearing, they really mean it. I hand washed mine in a bathroom sink. I could not believe the dirt left in the water.",US,2021-01-28
2,Too loose over the nose,"These are very comfortable to wear but there is a gap either side of the nose so that when you exhale, the air blows up into your eyes. I find this air flow very uncomfortable. Also the material is mostly polyester even though the ad says ""cotton blend"" (which is technically correct) it's mostly polyester.",US,2020-07-17
2,It gives the illusiaon of a mask,"The material is thin nylon. The purpose of the mask is to keep you from infecting others in many states it is mandatory in public places. It will fulfill the letter of the law for the mandatory mask decree but does not fulfill the purpose. The packaging stated to wash before first use and a lot of dye came out in the wash and now I have a bajillion stone grey socks. Finally, the ear loops are small and pull my ears forward. You will look like a howdy doody bank robber but you will be in compliance.",US,2020-08-09
2,Almost perfect.... poor quality,love the way these masks fit. I don't suffocate when wearing it for a few hours. Today was the first day I wore one and when I took it off realized it wasn't sewn properly and is coming apart. See picture. I was ready to buy more but the quality is not there so the search continues.,US,2020-07-15
2,Slides down when I talk,"I liked this mask when I got it. It's nice and comfortable, but it just seems to be too short between nose and chin, so it tends to slide down as my chin moves when I talk. It's more comfortable than disposable masks, but at least those stay up. I had read by a few people who said it was too big - I don't think so, I just think I need a bigger nose to hold it up!",US,2020-08-13
2,Use caution with the size you order,"Be careful of the size, I measured the bridge of my nose to my chin and added a little length. I ordered a large, which should have been big enough, it was smaller than I expected. I needed an extra inch (XL). The product is fine, it is a simple mask so how difficult is that to make, be aware of the size.",US,2020-09-18
2,NOT AS EFFICIENT AS EXPECTED,"Bought due to write up stating: Better breathability, stays in place if fit is correct. Followed the measuring directions twice to be sure; decided on LARGE as result of fit measurement. Once received, found mask keeps slipping down just like the 'throw-a-ways'? Breathing was no better than any others (I'm asthmatic so this is important).",US,2020-09-24
2,Comfortable but probably not protective,I agree with another reviewer who said that this mask fails the flame test. You can blow enough breath through the mask to extinguish a candle. That means that it probably would not provide an effective barrier against a cough or sneeze. Defeats the purpose of a coronavirus mask.,US,2020-12-14
2,One major flaw,"These are nice masks, fit well, and look great. They have one huge flaw, and that is the elastic is poor, so they end up getting very loose after wearing them a couple of times. One time through a gentle wash, and they have lost all elasticity, which is a bummer, because I really liked the way these masks fit. They still function ok, but they are constantly slipping down, which is a nuisance.",US,2020-11-18
2,low quality,"Low quality construction-

- cheap ear straps, thin elastic straps look nothing like the photos
- oversize cut- sticks out far from your mouth and face
- poor fit around nose- mask leaves large gaps on the sides of your nose
- oversized fit- mask is too larger overall",US,2020-10-14
2,"Great mask, questionable quality",Everything about these masks are great other than the quality is hit or miss - as soon as I went to put the first of three masks on the earpiece string detached. It was very poorly sewn together which was disappointing but the other 2/3 seem to be ok for now. If the first mask didn't rip immediately I'd give 5 stars but I question how long these other 2 will last - one star for each working mask,US,2020-07-15
2,Moves when talking,"The material is soft. It fits nicely. However, when you starting talking the mask moves down and no longer covers your nose. Your glasses will also fog when worn properly. The fit is loose. Nice attempt. If it had a nose clip, it would have 5 stars.",US,2020-07-16
2,"Too big, can't really use these","These (adult size) are too big for my 6 ft tall 170 pound man. He can't really use them.
Didn't return because we already opened and tried them.
I will keep them around in case someone larger stops by and needs one.
By the way, I used the size chart and ordered the size the chart indicated.",US,2020-07-02
2,Too big for 7-9 yr old,Daughter bought these for 7 & 9 yr. old girls. The elastic is very stretchy and overall mask too big in the nose area. Washed and dried in warm water and heat and no difference. Had to alter the masks on a sewing machine to make them fit right. So beware of the size.,US,2020-09-09
2,WAY too loose.,"Product is way too loose. No measurements listed anywhere. They claim ""large fits most adults"" and other reviews say a ""large is perfect for a petite woman"", but when you receive in hand, they're massive. Large is way too big for a 6' man, let alone a small woman unless you want a diaper hanging off your face. There isnt anything across the nose either - so expect loads of fog if you have glasses or wear safety goggles for work.",US,2020-11-04
2,"Not ""breatheable""","The worst thing about wearing a mask all day at work is the humidity and sweat from hot breath. This thing is really thick, like 2 or 3 layers, like a little pillow, and that means it's hot!

Probably fine if you just wear a mask for 30 minutes.",US,2020-09-01
2,Exposure of nose when talking,"Purchased these recently as I was in need of new masks. The biggest problem I have with these masks is that when I talk, the mask begins to fall and exposes my nose in the process. Possible that my small beard plays a part but these do not seem to be the solution for me.",US,2020-07-31
2,"Loops too large for child, fabric too small for teen or adult.","I have a 6 year old and a 9 year old. This fell right off both of them because the ear hoops were too long. I tied them together behind their heads in a pinch, but they weren‚Äôt comfortable wearing them. The fabric part is way too small for an adult. So these will be our last resort.",US,2020-09-23
2,"Honey, I shrunk my mask.","I was happy with the fit of the masks until I washed them a couple of times. They shrunk just enough to be uncomfortably snug making it more difficult to breathe. It‚Äôs dismaying because I deliberately chose to wash and dry them by hand, just to avoid shrinkage. Very disappointing.",US,2020-08-09
2,Not bad but heavy and warm,It‚Äôs like taking a really nice hoodie and cutting out a section and putting it over your face. So yes it‚Äôs comfortable and soft. But very warm and a little heavy. Also soaks up moisture. Not to be worn all day like I bought it for.,US,2020-07-28
2,"Single layer, smaller than expected for XL","Unfortunately, I fell for marketing-speak. While these are simple, decent quality masks, they are neither multiple layer nor as large as indicated for XL. If you just want a dust mask, these are fine but there isn‚Äôt adequate filtration.",US,2020-07-17
2,Traps moisture and is hot,These masks run quite large so they don't fit well. The worst part is the inside mesh type of fabric. It traps your breath and moisture. Therefore your face gets damp as well as makes you hot. Waste of money.,US,2020-10-22
2,"Has a hand-made feel, not sturdy, too flimsy","They're bigger, but the fit is all off for me personally. Take this with a grain of salt because everyone may fit differently, I wish there was a better way to measure and get an idea of the feel of various masks.",US,2020-10-05
2,Not worth it!,These masks fogged up my glasses so badly I really couldn‚Äôt wear them. I think that was because they fit so poorly which was especially disappointing because I paid more for then to avoid problems like these.,US,2020-10-17
2,poor fit if you talk with it on.,this is comfy to wear but if you talk at all it will pull the top down under your nose....,US,2020-09-18
2,Nope.,"The mask itself is nice but the ear loops however, are terrible! Mask would fit much better if the loops weren‚Äôt so cheap, crappy elastic. I‚Äôd return if my son didn‚Äôt HAVE to have these for school tomorrow. Big disappointment.",US,2020-09-07
2,Not XL. Just Regular,These are not XL mask. They barely reach my chin. Will give to the kids to use.,US,2020-07-15
2,I won't buy them again,"They don't seal to your face well. They don't have a nose wire to conform to the shape of your nose. So, they aren't effective in preventing air from slipping in past the mask.",US,2020-12-16
2,These have no wire or moldable nose pice,So the mask dose fit my large head but i wear glasses so with nothing to mold around the nose my glasses steam up consistently,US,2020-09-02
2,Too thin,Save yourself and do not buy. Sucks to your nose when you breathe.,US,2020-08-25
2,Too big for a 6 year old,"The ear loops are much too big for small children. They need to be at a minimum 1/3 smaller. I put one of the masks on and it fit me perfectly. So, I disagree that it is sized for children.",US,2020-07-09
2,Comfortable and fit great but..,"These masks fit really well and don't hurt my ears or touch my lips. These masks are comfortable at first however, they retain moisture which makes it very uncomfortable after a good 30min to 1 hr.",US,2020-10-28
2,Order not right,"you have the option to order the size you need but when I received these they were small, medium and large so my husband could only wear one mask out of the three.",US,2020-10-06
2,"You CAN blow out a lighter, candle or match.","Easy to breathe so real not good for COVID19. It is comfortable but gets hot. I bought XL before, too loose for me, these large ones do fit good. Sticking with surgical masks though.",US,2020-10-24
2,Glasses fog,"I have yet to find a mask that does not fog my glasses, with or without a nose bride.
Maybe it's my face or my glasses.",US,2021-02-03
2,Does not stay in place,"I measured and I was well within the range of the large size but this slides down and off the nose from just talking so it's useless for wearing if you need to talk. I suppose it'd be OK if you never talked, yawned, or moved your mouth. I wish it would have worked as it is comfortable when it's in place.",US,2020-07-30
2,Sweat to death,So hot and hard to breathe. But the topics were answered fairly. You should have a rating for .....does it do what it is supposed to? Comfort?,US,2020-08-12
2,Needs wire at nose bridge,"I wish there was some sort of wire reinforcement at the nose bridge.
My glasses were constantly fogging",US,2020-11-07
2,Look nice but not the best design,There is no pinch strap around the nose like the paper masks so the exhale is blown right into your eyes. This will fog up your glasses.,US,2020-11-10
2,They don't stay up on my nose,"I bought these because my cheaper ones wouldn't stay up on my nose... for about 3 times the price, these don't either...",US,2020-08-27
2,There must be a better one,"This was highly recommended as the best mask for travel. It is very soft, so comfortable, but it collapses on my mouth.",US,2020-11-29
2,Too small beware,Poor quality straps break 50% of the time when you're putting them on. They are to small an adult,US,2020-10-28
2,Medium is Small,IMHO medium is very small - barely covers nose and chin. Don‚Äôt waste your money on the overpriced masks,US,2020-09-22
2,Too loose for kids,I purchased Small for my 5 yo kid and the masks are way too loose (and he has a big head). They will probably fit adults better.,US,2020-08-17
2,Too big and smells gross,I measured as instructed and the medium is still way too large on me. There's also a gross chemical smell.,US,2020-08-18
2,Smell,These are comfortable and light weight but they have a strange smell that has not come out after repeated washing.,US,2020-08-13
2,Great for a small child...maybe,"Too small... Ordered ""Large."" Perhaps they meany large toddler? Seem fairly breathable.",US,2020-10-23

2,"comfortable, but elastic broke after wearing twice","Pack of 3. Very comfortable. No gaps, good coverage. However, I wore one of the masks just twice and the elastic stretched and broke at the point where it connects into the mask. I wore the second one today and it's OK so far.",US,2020-08-04
2,Difficult to breathe with this mask,"I did not like this product, difficult to breathe with it on, especially if the weather is warm.",US,2020-07-23
2,Shrank after washing,I have a big head so I was looking for an XL face mask that wouldn‚Äôt pull on my ears. These appeared to fit great when I tried them on after first receiving them. Then I washed them in hot water (as recommended) and they shrunk. Now they are too small.,US,2020-07-21

 I read reviews about this mask not passing the candle test. I tried it myself. I don't see how one can blow a candle with this mask on. The sunlight test was concerning though. I did see one too many sparkles... Also the mask smells. Not sure if that's the soap residue, but I don't think so.",Canada,2020-09-12
3,Sizing confusion,"Sizing is very confusing. If these are really Enerplex masks, then why is amazon‚Äôs size DIFFERENT than the Enerplex website‚Äôs??? Went with Amazon‚Äôs recommendation of Large as it states it fits most faces, but found they were much too big. Wanted to exchange for smaller size but had to pay for shipping again. Had to use needle and thread on them to manually fit my face.
Other than this, masks are really soft, light and comfortable. Would have given this a 4 out of 5 but for size and colour issues: colour is not really permanent. Slight discolouration upon each wash.",Canada,2020-08-17
3,Mask May Not Be the Size that You Ordered.,"I ordered 3 packages of different colours, all size large. The white and black packages came one day. The blue package came several days later. The blue masks were much larger than the white and black masks. The size is shown on the package but there is no size label on the masks themselves. Obviously one of our packages is a different size, but we cannot tell which package had the wrong sized masks because all three packages indicate that that the enclosed masks are ""large"". So ... my advice is to see if your mask fits; if not it may because the wrong size was sent.",Canada,2020-11-10
3,"Okay, but XL is not XL, and I received different sizes in one package","Face masks are fine - they are a step up from the cheaper variety you will find on Amazon. I ordered the XL size, but they should not be called that - they are Large as compared to most other brands I've tried. Also, I ordered the 3 mask package in XL, but only 2 of the 3 masks were the correct size, and one was much smaller and doesn't fit.",Canada,2020-08-09
3,comfy,"I bought 2 sizes XL & L, for my husband and myself. The sizing for XL is spot on and comfy to use but i'm not sure about the other sizing. From the size chart, i was meant to be a large and the large ended up being too big for me, i couldn't return cos i needed it urgently",Canada,2020-08-19
3,Comfortable but a bit itchy,"There is no metal band at the part where it crosses the nose, so your glasses will fog up, and that means that you do not have a good seal on your face. It is well made, easily washable, comfortable to wear and is three layers deep, all woven though. Better masks have a non woven layer for better filtration. I found it became itchy despite the fact that the fabric is soft and a comfortable fit.",Canada,2020-12-11
3,"Meh. Better than the paper masks, but needs work.","They would be better if they had put a metal piece above the nose to create a better seal. I cut mine open and shoved a wire inside, it works. Comfort of mask is ok - i dont have a big head so I got the medium size, and they seem a little too small. But workable. They can be quite warm and uncomfortable after about fifteen minutes indoors. Outdoors they work as a great wind breaker in the winter.",Canada,2020-12-09
3,Tissu int√©rieur difficile √† respirer / Pour courte dur√©e seulement,"Masque tr√®s confortable. Ne tire pas les oreilles . Par contre,
L'√©paisseur du tissu qui se trouve contre la bouche (l'√©paisseur int√©rieur) est en coton doux , mais ouf, difficile √† respirer √† la longue. Je le conseille seulement pour une petit sortie (√©picerie de courte dur√©e, d√©panneur etc) mais malheureusement je l'ai essay√© 3h au travail et non.... De plus, le fait de respirer , la bouche cr√©√© toujours de la condensation habituellement normalement tol√©rable mais avec ces masques, le coton int√©rieur devient facilement '' humide'' √† force d'expirer l'air de la bouche. Un peu d√©sagr√©able, c'est pour cela que je conseille plus pour un usage ce courte dur√©e.",Canada,2021-01-27
3,Large is too small,"I bought the large size and am disappointed. The cloth is soft and seems of quality but I look like dumbo the elephant with my ears uncomfortably pulled forward with the elastic strings straining. It also just barely covers my chin and nose. If you have a relatively large face I would not recommend, even if you order the large size.",Canada,2020-12-09
3,"Great for small amounts of time, bummer for extended time periods.","At first the mask seems fine, but wearing it in any sort of heat (summer), and/or for an extended amount of time gets really uncomfortable. Super hot and steamy... Plus when you breath the mask is heavy enough that it sucks in on your inhale. Wearing it for short periods is fine enough though. (5 hour shift serving at a bar, no. Half hour trip to the grocery store, sure).",Canada,2020-08-17
3,Super comfortable and light,"Exactly as described, and fits my face perfectly. It's comfortable enough to almost forget it's there, because of how light it is. However, I took off a couple stars because I wish they extended the elastic to the nose bridge portion, or even added a wire nose bridge. There is a not-so-insignificant nose bridge gap with these, which impacts how effective the mask itself actually is.",Canada,2021-02-05
3,Inconsistent Sizing,"I do like the style and softness of these, but the sizing is quite frustrating. All 3 masks have a different shape/fit. One was slightly smaller in length from the nose to the chin so it tends to pull down a bit more when talking. One gaps open under the chin. One has excess fabric in the front because of the cut of the fabric (a more pronounced curvature). And I had to tie a knot in the ear elastics of all 3 to prevent them from falling off my face because they were too loose. I also wish that they had a wire in the nose for a more secure fit, so I will probably try buying a different brand next time.",Canada,2020-08-27
3,Received wrong size.,"Ordered a pack in Medium size, after checking the measurements. While finishing ordering, the basket showed the item was youth/small adult. Tried few times by emptying the shopping basket and chosing the right size ‚ÄòMedium‚Äô, which would populate my basket without giving correct size info. Getting tired, I ordered anyways. Order received on time, size on the inside package marked as small. I had to wash it before trying for size verification. Sure enough, it‚Äôs a bit smaller. Medium size would have been perfect. Be Careful when ordering. The system should NOT fill our shopping basket with a different size if size required is out of stock. Stuck with something that can‚Äôt use.",Canada,2020-08-17
3,Large is smaller than expected and I'm a small guy,"These masks are made for very tiny, tiny, tiny people. I'm a normal sized white guy with normal features, including normal sized head. And large is way too small, even my wife's is too small for same order. XXL would be more appropriate, but not available.",Canada,2020-12-07
3,"It‚Äôs too big, won‚Äôt shrink, and it is very hot to wear it all the time","I measured as per guidelines, and ordered size L (which is the smallest adult size). Still the mask is too big, the ear straps are too long and loose, they are not adjustable. The mask is soft, but breathability is below average ‚Äî after a period of time it is too hot inside the mask.",Canada,2020-08-16
3,Not pleased,"I am not pleased with these masks because the product description says that they can be shaped to your nose size, but these masks can not. Also the elastics have expanded with just about four wears.
I do not recommend these masks.",Canada,2020-09-03
3,Slips down my nose,"When I first put this mask on I thought it was quite comfortable. However, after wearing it for about 5 minutes I found that the portion of the mask that covers my nose kept slipping down. This issue was especially prevalent if I talked while wearing the mask, but even if I was just walking with my mouth closed it still constantly kept slipping down my nose. I consulted the sizing guide prior to purchasing so I don't think this issue is related to mask size/fit but rather the fact that this mask *does not* have a flexible wire around the nose portion.",Canada,2020-11-11
3,Be sure in your measurements,mask meets all the specs as advertised except the size. I measured and re-measured to be sure I selected the right size. Unfortunately my masks are too big. I tried one and it fell below my nose. I shortened the earloop but that only distorted the shape. I suggest measure carefully and maybe go the next size smaller or be very sure about the size.,Canada,2020-08-26
3,XL is not very XL,"Even though I purchased the XL sized face masks, I find once I start talking my nose very quickly pops out over the top of the mask. I have tried positioning the mask higher on my face, as well as flipping it over in case 1 way sat better than the other, but it keeps happening... and my head is not gigantic or anything.

Right now, no-one wants an embarrassing nose-tip slip when they are in a mandatory ""masks on"" situation, so its a little disappointing",Canada,2020-09-09
3,"Good mask, but concern on QC","Awesome masks, very comfortable and breathable. However, one of the three has torn apart ear loop after FIRST TIME use. So I am not sure with the durability of the material or quality control of the product.",Canada,2021-01-14
3,XL was too big,I thought having a bigger face to order the XL but they were way too big. It did not hug my face as right as I would like so I am going down a size. They weren‚Äôt bad with respect to eye glass fog and breathable,Canada,2020-10-28
3,"Black ones perfect, blue ones inconsistent","I ordered 3 packs of the black ones in a size medium and large, and they were fantastic. Super comfortable and lightweight. However I ordered the blue ones in a size medium yet the masks were super inconsistent. One was a size large even tho it came in the medium pack, another had longer ear straps, and only one was actually normal. This issue was only with the blue ones, not the black.",Canada,2020-08-29
3,Not for people who wear glasses.,"Quality is okay. Ear straps are a bit on the short side. There are no wires in this mask and therefore air blows upwards and fogs my glasses, no matter how I adjust the mask or my glasses on my face.

If you don't wear glasses these masks are fine.",Canada,2020-10-02
3,Not bad...,"These masks arrived very quickly. Yes, they are light but hold in more heat than my vented ones. They also lack an adjustable nose wire.

Beyond that, they do the job. Just not great if you wear glasses.",Canada,2020-10-22
3,These are NOT. XL,These are not XL. They measure the same as a med my daughter has. Cheap ear pieces and simple do not cover face,Canada,2020-08-05
3,"OK, would only recommend if your in a pinch","Just your average cloth mask. Easy to wash, soft and doesn‚Äôt hurt the face. Don‚Äôt know how effective it is against the covid, but beats using a blue disposal mask. Only complaint, is if you wear glasses they do fog as there is no nose piece.",Canada,2020-08-15
3,Good masks but sizing is off,"I ordered a set of these masks in Large and quite liked them, so I ordered another pack of Large masks and a pack of XL ones for my partner. However, the second set of ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù masks were much larger than the first pack I ordered. They seem to actually be the XL size, but they were in a package that said ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù. I would like more if these masks, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm willing to just hope that the right size in the right packaging comes next time.",Canada,2020-10-15
3,Only ok.,My 14yr old likes these. They are soft and feel nice but they do not have a nose wire and they tend to slip down your nose a bit. They don‚Äôt feel as thick as some other masks I‚Äôve tried. I did not do a candle test.,Canada,2020-11-11
3,Comfortable and good fit but...,I've been very happy since I received these Monday August 17. I've been wearing them most days traveling and working and they've been very comfortable even with my big head. I've washed them each twice (not noticing any shrinking) but just noticed the stitching coming off on one mask already at work. I'll double check the other 2 when I get home but hopefully this is an isolated incident.,Canada,2020-08-27
3,It's okay,"I liked how easy to breathe it was but unfortunately if you ever have to talk to someone, it slides off your nose. Maybe it was a size issue but it's the only mask I have that constantly slides down.",Canada,2020-11-11
3,White large size smaller than black large,"Beware. While these are comfortable, the white large are considerably smaller than the black large. I bought both and the white are less comfortable. If you overlay the white on black the size of the white is definitely smaller.",Canada,2020-11-16
3,Inconsistent Sizing,"I liked the thickness of the fabric and the softness. However, the sizing is inconsistent. One of the three masks fit me, the others were way too large. I would suggest sizing down. I ordered according to size chart and measurements.",Canada,2020-11-28
3,Large is not really large.,I like the texture and colour. I measured and used the size chart and purchased large size but they do not fit. Too small. The other large ones I purchased from another seller fit fine. Gave these to my grand kids.,Canada,2020-11-04
3,Slightly too big despite being within specifications,Earloops are flimsy. Slips off when talking more passionately - could be just me. Might want to consider sizing down if you‚Äôre on the lower end of specifications.,Canada,2020-11-11
3,Good but not great at the gym,I bought these for the gym since reviews mentioned breathable / good exercise. They aren‚Äôt. They are decent masks for general wear but not the gym.,Canada,2021-01-27
3,did not meet expectations.,Unfortunately material caused noticable irritations to the cheeks of the wearer. Not suitable for individuals that have sensitively skin.,Canada,2020-08-04
3,It‚Äôs okay but the fit around nose is not great,"The fabric is very soft, however, the fit around the nose is not that good. It‚Äôs a little loose and my glasses fogged up every time I wore it.",Canada,2020-09-12
3,Too big for my face,"Nice fabric, but it‚Äôs too big for my face.. Tried to return it for the smaller size, but they won‚Äôt except them.. NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN!!!",Canada,2020-11-30
3,softNcomfy,"XL initially too big and large moved around too much when talking. Washed them all and tightened the string a bit on the XL and i've got a really nice fit now.
only concern is the elasticity of the string.",Canada,2020-09-10
3,Well constructed but Hot,"Comfortable Material to wear, Sizing is small, So Up size as others have said. I find them Hot after wearing them for over an hour,",Canada,2020-10-04
3,Very light but comfortable.,"Not sure how effective but very comfortable and soft. Fit is good and soft, but the mask has a tendancy to slip down.....adequate not special.",Canada,2020-10-29
3,Have no nose wires,"The material is nice. Size is also OK, but the lack of nose wires makes the mask is not suitable for the cases you need to speak with surrounding people or wearing glasses.",Canada,2020-12-11
3,1 of the 3 masks can't be used,"Overall an OK mask but one out of the three masks I received in the set has bad stitching which causes it to collapse inward, making it basically unusable. This is extremely frustrating when you expect to get three usable masks :(",Canada,2020-09-26
3,"Good,","Wrong size, but I returned it and bought large, great product overall, but wrong size. The brand contacted me saying how they wanted to give me a free 3 pack of L masks for free because of the inconvenience. They are super sweet! Thanks!",Canada,2020-11-14
3,Bon produit,"Confortable, l√©ger et doux. On est √† notre 60 √®me lavage, le tissu est encore bon. J‚Äôen ai achet√© pour ma femme mes trois enfants et moi.",Canada,2020-11-15
3,Runs large,This is a lightweight and soft mask. I feel it‚Äôs a bit warm and is big for my face. I bought a large but I guess a medium should be enough.,Canada,2020-10-10
3,"Good mask, sub par elastic.",These masks initially have a great fit and comfort. The only problem was that the elastics very rapidly began to lose strength and get stretched out. It appears to return slightly after washing but noticed a big difference in the fit after only a few washes.,Canada,2020-09-10
3,Not too bad...,Much smaller then shown on line .would recommend a larger size for adults..wash well before use however a bit afraid to put in dryer due to potential shrinkage.,Canada,2020-11-20
3,Great masks but earloops ripped after first wash,Would have loved to give these 5 stars but 2/3 of the mask earloops ripped after washing and drying according to the given instructions. I love the one mask that remained intact but disappointed that that the other 2 ripped after first wash.,Canada,2021-01-11
3,Almost Perfect,"With a size-adjusting bead and longer ear straps these would be perfect.

Size of mask is ideal but way too much pressure behind my ears. Gives me a headache.",Canada,2020-11-24
3,Review,"Fit and quality is good, not great the only thing is the bands are too loose for adult or youth size they keep falling off. I wish it had adjustable bands. I just tied a knot to shorten the bands length for my kid and it works fine. If your kid is wearing glasses it will fog up.",Canada,2020-09-24
3,Face mask,These are ok no nose piece don‚Äôt feel the three layers just seems like one layer. A little disappointed in product,Canada,2020-12-01
3,"Very comfortable, but warm.",These masks are very soft and comfortable to wear. But it gets warm in those things. We found out that the best for breathing is still the disposable ones.,Canada,2020-08-15
3,Run large,"Excellent quality, but run large. I ordered the adult size first, then the youth. Even those were too big. An expensive mistake, as I know I can‚Äôt return them. ‚òπÔ∏è",Canada,2020-11-23
3,Keeps falling down. Good mask in comparison,Doesn‚Äôt stay up. Needs nosepiece. Great last compared to others in market. And fits my xxl face.,Canada,2020-10-20
3,"Thinner than expected, missing a must have",These are thinner than expected and do not have a flexible metal noise piece built in.,Canada,2020-12-01
3,Size issues,"I followed the sizing chart and measured it as directed for my kids which indicated a large. I thought that was odd for kids, but ordered it as indicated. Sure enough the 5"" measurement for kids is wrong. The ear loops are much to loose.",Canada,2020-08-28
3,It's okay,It's not amazing. I wasn't blown away but I guess its better than the blue masks.,Canada,2020-12-06
3,Don‚Äôt listen to the sizes,I have an over all 3 on this because the ear straps need to be a bit tighter I had to put a loop in them so the mask fits my face properly if not for that 5 stars,Canada,2020-08-24
3,"Not breathable, very hot",The masks get very hot. Not the most breathable and leave an odd odor on your face. Nice fit but otherwise it‚Äôs average.,Canada,2020-11-27

3,Love them but,I love them but regular N95 masks are easier to breathe in,Canada,2021-01-23
3,Not for big noses.,"They‚Äôre soft, but it feels like a sweatshirt covering your mouth, a little too thick, and if you have a medium to large nose, they‚Äôll be uncomfortable. No Nose wire either. They‚Äôll do for quick store runs but I wouldn‚Äôt want this all day.",Canada,2020-08-18
3,EnerPlex Youth mask,"Bought this for my child who went back to school. He says it works and is ok. The only downside is the size, a tad too big. Also, I think it is a bit pricey should be cheaper.",Canada,2020-09-22
3,Nice reusable cloth mask,It a bit warm wearing it but it fits well and is comfortable.,Canada,2020-08-12

3,Hard to breath through. Otherwise comfy,All masks such. Hot to hard to breath in this one but comfy,Canada,2021-02-03
3,"Fit large, thick material and not very breathable",The masks fit large and are quite thick. I found them not very breathable and I would get very hot under them. Ok to wear for a short period but way too warm to wear for a longer period and indoors.,Canada,2020-09-25
3,Meh,These will make you glasses fog like crazy. They are comfortable. But they are warm.,Canada,2020-09-12
3,Not one size fits all.,These masks will only fit snugly if you have a large head. The straps are not adjustable or tight enough to stay on a smaller face comfortably. Otherwise they are quite nice.,Canada,2021-01-08
3,I would recommend to bigger noses.,The product didn‚Äôt fit my face very well as there was a lot of space between the mast and my nose. Not meant for my small nose but the material was breathable.,Canada,2020-09-20

3,Good value for fabric masks,"This set of three masks is decently made. The fabric is average. I do have a much finer weave fabric mask with a lining that is harder to breathe in (which is good in terms of safety).

I like this style of mask that goes under your chin. It's more secure and the shape helps to hold the sides closer to your cheeks. This also goes high enough up the nose to stay covered while you speak.

I prefer masks that secure behind your head like a blindfold. I don' tknow why that's not more common - it's way more comfortable than earloops.

The one comment I'd make is to think carefully about getting black masks - they draw heat and it's already hot wearing a mask!",Canada,2020-07-26
3,Very THICK material,I could hardly breathe in these. I feel they are too thick. I stopped using them for work (which was why I purchased them) lol. I only wear for short period like going to store. If you can manage the thickness then it is very fineü§ó,Canada,2020-09-18
3,Not What I Expected,"Overall it is an okay product, but actually I don't feel as protected so will not be using it as often as my disposal surgical masks. It is very lightweight, soft and comfortable but I need more protection from COVID 19. I think it is as advertised just didn't realize that the disposal masks offer more protection. Thus the 3 star Average Review.",Canada,2020-12-02
3,Not adjustable,Nothing really wrong with this product but only giving three stars as they are not adjustable,Canada,2021-01-14
3,"Comfortable, but not sure how effective","These are comfortable but thin-ish. Cannot adjust the ear loops. No nose piece to make snug there (although is shaped quite well do does fit pretty good over the nose). Cannot add a filter. Now, with new guidance on better masks, this is going to become our 'over the real mask' cover. Will add an extra layer, and is a nicely made, just don't think it's what it really required to stay safe. For a mask cover, or maybe on their own and being outside, this is okay, but I wouldn't be wearing these for long durations indoors with other people.",Canada,2021-02-02

3,Classiques,"Il faut imp√©rativement les laver car, d'origine, il ont une forte odeur.
Sinon, une fois lav√©s, tout va bien, assez confortable (si un masque peut √™tre confortable)",France,2021-02-05
3,Comfortable But Failed the Flame Test,"Pros:

I live in New York. So mandatory masks has been going on since April. I have tried so many masks. These masks are very comfortable. Fits perfectly. I got a large and feels wonderful. Comfortable. Breathable and Stretchable.

Cons:

Failed the flame test. If you want to know if your mask is doing a good job protecting you and others. Get a lighted match. Put on the mask and cough much as you can. With this mask I knocked out the flame on my third try and the flame goes everywhere every time. That means micro droplets can fly out your mouth and into the air and vice versa.

Conclusion:

These masks feels good but in the protective category it is troubling. Best bet is to double up these masks. I did that and the flame never moved. I can still breath and feel comfortable with two on. Or combined with a surgical mask they sell at the pharmacy. Wearing these singles is risky.",US,2020-07-14
3,Too Big!,"I got the size large because that's what it suggested for normal size adults. I guess I'm not ""normal"" sized. I should have got a size medium instead of large. The large is just too big on my face and there is a huge gap under my chin so it doesn't feel like it is protecting me like it should. I should also mention it was still too big after washing and drying it and trying to shrink it. Which it did shrink a little bit but not enough. It is soft and comfortable but does not feel protective and foggs up my sunglasses when I wear it.",US,2020-07-21
3,Different size masks are the same size ear to ear,"I like almost everything about these masks.

Only the height of the mask is different between the S, M, and L masks. The distance from ear to ear is exactly the same which is frustrating as I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and buying different sizes if I had known that.

The small fit my thin 8 yo boy fine for height but I had to tie a slip knot in the ear loops so the mask will stay up. I may consider racking them with sewing thread after we figure out what size will be comfortable for a full day a camp.",US,2020-07-23
3,Soft feel but no nose wire! :(,"These are probably the softest masks I've experienced yet against my skin and I was SO glad to find a company that does actual sizes! Especially since my husband needed an XL for his beard. SADLY THOUGH, there is no nose wire!! GAH!! It would have been five stars, raving from the rooftops if so! But sadly, it does not, which gives a lot of space above the mask for air to get in and out and I was CONSTANTLY having to pull it back up when talking bc it would slide down below my nose...which defeats the purpose of not touching your mask and keeping you safely covered at all times. I also got a set for my husband who works out a lot outside, hoping it would be a more comfortable option, but alas, he had the same issues with it sliding down and said it was HOT to keep on outside. So I guess the take away is if you don't care about the nose wire, you won't be speaking in it, and you don't need it for outside, it is a good option. (I do highly recommend, however, that the company makes it clear that there is no nose wire in the mask. I did hours of research and when I got to these, I thought my prayers had been answered because it looked so structured, I assumed there HAD to be a wire in it.) :(",US,2020-07-21
3,Im keeping but would not order again.,"These are soft and comfortable but a little difficult to breath in. I see people complaining they are not 3 ply. I doubt that because if they were any thicker, you would not be able to breath. My complaint (besides they are hot) is that they have no metal strip to conform over the top of your nose. My glasses are continually fogging up. Because of this I would not recommend to eye glass wearers. I will keep for family members but keep looking for me.",US,2020-07-17
3,Not for Glasses Wearers,"These do not work for me at all, because there is not a good seal around my nose and my glasses fog up immediately. Glasses wearers need a bendable nose piece to create a good seal and these do not have this essential feature. I give them 3 stars anyway, because these masks would be OK for people without glasses. I wish I had read the questions.",US,2020-07-19
3,"Not optimal for us, might work for others","Nice quality material, really soft and well sewn. Horrible smell; I'll wash and see whether that mitigates it. Ear straps are super comfy and it conforms to face well other than the height, i.e., its main problem is that it doesn't cup down under chin, or if you try to make it do so, you pull it down off nose. This is for a medium size. I think a contributing problem is not having a wired portion for the bridge of the nose. Even if it had that, however, mask would still be too short to fit our 12-year-old or me--I'm about same size (5'3"" small boned female) although with different face shape. Way too short to fit our older teenager or my husband. If I can get the smell out, i'll consider buying a size up, although lack of wire might be a deal-breaker since there's no significant elastic anywhere to help keep it on (i.e., the material itself is a knit, which gives it some stretch, but that's not enough on its own to keep it up). First thing is to get rid of the smell . . . and i'm not really that sensitive to smells; this one is just that bad.",US,2020-08-11
3,Nice but looks like underwear,"I made the mistake of getting the white masks. While they are comfortable and fit well, they look exactly like underwear. It‚Äôs basically like wearing a jock strap.",US,2020-07-21
3,Has the same problems as masks in general,"This mask is comfortable to wear, importantly 3-ply and fits quite well since it is formed at the top to fit over the nose.
However, it suffers all the usual problems I have found with mask wearing; it rides down, exposing your nose, when you have a conversation, it causes glasses to fog up and it's hot and sweaty if worn in a warm humid environment.
There is no metal to conform and hold it tightly over your nose. I have added a strip of adhesive bandage along the entire top edge, but found that has limited benefit in stopping my glasses from fogging up as the still vapor blows out in all directions through the material like a leaky balloon when exhaling and the bandage hurts to pull it off! That does help to stop it riding down though. It seems like the top half, middle ply should be non-porous material to limit the upward movement of moisture-laden breath, with a bendable metal strip.
I would say these masks are nothing special, but they do do the job and are well-made. Hopefully a time when we can go out mask-less is not too many months away.",US,2020-12-24
3,Amazon wont tell where its made???,"Amazon must of removed the locations of where products come from. I used to only order American made but they removed where all their products are made. This one is from Vietnam. It's easy to breath through and a nice mask, but still I was unable to easily support American made product because they hid that info.",US,2020-07-29
3,Great masks - edit: didn't pass candle test,"I'm really happy with my purchase. The mask is very soft on my face and is more breathable than the previous one. They're easy to wash/clean and seem durable so far, I've been wearing them for a couple months. The main reason I chose this mask was because they had great sizing options and weren't one size fits all. I'm a petite woman and the Youth/Adult Medium fits perfectly. It's snug (not tight) and covers the area from the middle of my nose to a little under my chin. I rest my glasses on top of the piece on my nose to prevent fogging. If I need more masks I'll definitely repurchase these.

Edit: I lost a couple of these and was going to repurchase, but then I found out about the candle test which this does not pass. I really loved these masks, but now concerned about the level of protection they offer.",US,2020-10-25
3,"Great fit, looks great, not as advertised.","The reason I purchased these masks were for an all day outing at Universal Studios, where they are currently requiring all park visitors to wear a mask. I live in FL, and I knew what to expect with our weather in mid July. I wanted something comfortable and breathable, hence the reason I chose this product based on review ""Breathable Comfort"". So you might be asking, why three stars? I was really hoping and leaning into the keyword 'Breathable' here. And they are no less breathable then any other face mask I've worn. Definitely not as breathable as the generic hospital masks you get for free when you visit your doctor. This is the reason for the 3 star review. It's just not any breathable than any other face mask I've worn. Based on just that, I would have given the product a 1, BUT I didn't because this product does have some other qualities that outshine other masks I've worn. They do look good when worn compared to other masks. They're very comfortable, I wore the mask for probably 7 hours straight that day, on hour 6 and 7, my ears wear getting sore, but I stretched out the ears straps a bit, and it was back to comfort. If I was to give this manufacturer an award, I would award them the 'most fashionable' mask. I should also throw in the fact that I HATE masks. Before they were mandated by grocery stores, theme parks, etc, I never wore one. So if you are those people that have been wearing masks (voluntarily) since the beginning of the pandemic, you might think it's breathable ;)",US,2020-07-29
3,"Add 3/4"" if you want to talk while wearing","Measurements do not take into account trying to talk with these masks; for this and all other non-pleated masks you should add the distance your mouth opens when you talk (about 3/4"" for me) else the mask keeps slipping off your nose or chin.

Could use a wire on the nose as well.

Overall I find the disposable masks with fabric folds that can expand when you talk much superior to these non-pleated masks.",US,2020-08-05
3,Couldn‚Äôt breathe well & shrinkage,"For me, even after following wash instructions exactly, these have shrunk way too much. Also, they are way to think for me & I was hoping for breathe ability. They may work great for some. The quality of workmanship is very high as far as fabric and sewing.",US,2020-07-09
3,Ear loops needed adjusting for adequate fit on young children,"The face covering part of these is a great fit for my 3, 4, and 6 year old. The problem is the ear loops. They are too big, causing the mask to droop which creates completely inadequate coverage. To fix the issue, I tied the ear loops in a knot, which fixed the coverage issue, but creates discomfort for my children‚Äôs ears.

I know they make little plastic things you can use to adjust the size of the ear loops, but I didn‚Äôt want to have to purchase something extra. These masks are decently priced, but I ended up purchasing others that are comparably priced and don‚Äôt require adjustments or the purchase of ear loop adjusters.

The material of these masks is soft and breathable, and if your children are older or have larger faces, they may work. I would recommend them maybe for older children or suggest that if you want to try these, buy the ear look adjusters as well.",US,2020-10-02
3,They don‚Äôt stay put.,"These are comfortable, soft masks, but they don‚Äôt stay on my face. They keep sliding down forcing me to adjust the mask constantly. They are also not consistent in size. One fits my face well, the other 2 are much smaller and barely cover my chin. I have a small face so this size should have been ok for me. Washed them before wearing them as recommended in the instructions. They pass the test of blowing a match, too bad they don‚Äôt have a nose metal strip that can be closed to prevent breath from escaping from the top and fogging glasses. Although the thickness is fine, I don‚Äôt feel protected wearing them because they slide and air escapes from the top.",US,2020-12-22
3,Very Comfortable - wish there were more colors,"This is one of the most comfortable masks I've gotten (and I've tried many). What would make it perfect? If the XL was a bit bigger. The size different between L and XL is barely noticeable - less than 1/2 inch. If it came in more colors (like a darker blues/greens/teal/charcoal gray or even purple would be nice. Have to be very careful about where we put them to keep mine and my husband's apart when they're all black, and I don't like the pale blue or white). Thinking of bleaching patterns on them to tell them apart, if I can do that w/damaging the fabric. I'm also thinking of adding a filter pocket... though not sure how that will affect the comfort. Adjustable straps and metal nosepiece would be nice, but seems can't get everything I want in one mask.",US,2020-09-14
3,Odd smell after washing,Product looks good. Washed in laundry & put in dryer for a bit. Tried on & had a weird yucky smell. Rewashing by hand. Anyone have this problem? Please advise!,US,2020-07-01
3,I still get air blowing into my eyes,"The mask is cool looking, but it suffers from the same problem as every other cloth mask. It doesn't fit snugly around your nose and you get air blowing up into your eyes. This could be solved by inserting some sort of rigid wire into the nose portion of the mask, like disposable masks, I'm not sure why no cotton mask has fixed this problem, to my knowledge. I have some other cheap cotton masks that I bought for like $0.50 a piece that I stick a paperclip into the top portion in order to make them keep their shape, and then I just take the paper clip out whenever I launder them. I continue to use that method rather than these more expensive ones.",US,2020-12-22
3,"OK, but lack of a fitted nosepiece compromises seal. 5-star customer service","This mask is OK, but it lacks a moldable, semi-rigid nosepiece. This means that plenty of air enters over the nose. I have a goatee and find that because of the lack of a nosepiece, as I talk, the mask is pulled lower and lower. I would classify this as a comfortable modest safety upgrade from a bandana, best for someone interested in comfort and compliance, but not very worried about protecting themselves.

Edit: The seller, Mayfair, went out of their way, both before my review was posted and after to ensure my satisfaction, with no requests or suggestions to alter my review. They simply wanted to be certain I was satisfied.",US,2020-09-27
3,comfortable but need to constantly adjust,"These work well as long as you are not engaged in a conversation with someone. They are comfortable to wear and do not pull or hurt the ears. However, everytime I start talking, the mask gets pulled under my nose and I constantly have to readjust ... which means you are constantly touching the outside of the mask with your hands and as someone who works in healthcare that a big NO NO as you are now spreading the germs from the outside of your mask all over the place. I mostly use these masks when I go to the store or walking through ""common areas"" of places and typically do not engage in many conversations, so for the most part it fits my needs.",US,2020-08-06
3,Durable but hard to breathe through,"Nicely packaged and well sewn. Launders easily. Would have been 5 stars but for the fact that they are difficult to breathe through. Exhaled air goes up into eyeglasses and fogs them. I recommend these only in cooler climates for the young and healthy having no glasses or breathing problems.

UPDATE: The seller of this item went out of their way to contact me several times regarding this review. They offered return and replace options to correct this issue. Despite my rating of the product, my rating of the seller is 5 stars.",US,2020-09-12
3,Strap broke after only a few uses,"My husband is an essential worker who must wear a mask daily, so we rotate through a set of 6, which means he wears each one no more than once a week. We purchased these less than one month ago and one of the straps already snapped while he was wearing it. He'll use the others until they break, but we won't purchase this brand again.",US,2020-09-18
3,Quality mask... but needs a XXL size,"I like the mask, the material fells good and it‚Äôs not that hard to breathe out of.... my main issue is that the mask could be a little bigger to fit my face. So maybe a XXL would be perfect.

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5 and 300 lbs. and when I wear the mask, the top portion of the mask sits right in the middle of the bridge of my nose which makes it uncomfortable for me and hard to talk without constantly having to readjust the mask. Also the straps that loops behind the ears pulls kind of hard on the cartilage on the back of my ears.

So I believe increasing the size offered for this mask would correct this.",US,2020-08-14
3,"Great mask, go X-large if you‚Äôre 5‚Äô9‚Äù or better.","UPDATE - I received an e-mail regarding my satisfaction of the facemask. I mentioned the sizing as per their chart wasn‚Äôt adequate. They‚Äôre sending X-Large. Fantastic follow up ! Great service ! Right off the top, throw out their sizing recommendations. If you‚Äôre 6‚Äô go for the extra large, period. Material is nice, seams are nicely finished. Good breathability. Wash them before initial use. As for comfort, I don‚Äôt find any mask by any producer, comfortable.",US,2021-01-24
3,Laughably Undersized,"I've ordered three sets of these and can confidently say that are laughably undersized. The ""small/kid size"" ones that I received looked like they were meant for a child under age one. I ended up giving the large ones I ordered for myself to my 7 year old, and they fit him almost perfectly. I don't have a particularly large face or head, but even the XL ones are just slightly too small to fit without tugging and pulling down when I talk, but luckily I always wear two disposable masks under my cloth mask. Would not recommend these to anyone.",US,2020-11-12
3,"Good, sort of...","I bought the XL and it is incredibly comfortable and breathing is easy. The only reason for three stars instead of five is that there is no wire across the nose bridge. It doesn‚Äôt make for a secure fit and if you wear glasses, the lack of a secure fit means your exhalation causes your glasses to fog up.",US,2020-08-07
3,Comfortable but not as breathable as they say.,"Ordered these because they said they were light weight. While they‚Äôre super comfortable on your face, they are not easily breathable. I have to wear a mask for most of my workday with safety glasses on my face as well. They‚Äôre better than many of my masks as far as not fogging up my safety glasses but my face is unbelievably sweaty with them on. Don‚Äôt buy if you have to wear a mask all day long, not bad for just a quick trip into the grocery store though.",US,2020-08-17
3,"Nice large size, covers well. Definitely not breathable.","I ordered these to throw in the car for when I forget to grab my regulars and these are by far better than the disposables but after 15 min of wearing this, you are ready for a break. The material is just to thick to wear for very long. I was happy about the size, it covers the areas most masks don't. I wasn't constantly pulling the mask up over my nose. The ear elastic was comfortable too, just needs a thinner material for breathing.",US,2020-10-06
3,"Good Quality, but Needs Nose Clip","I bought these to have a breathable face mask with more polyester or spandex material than cotton. When I received them, they seemed like they were quality masks. However, there is no metal nose clip so there are gaps around the material on the bridge of my nose. I don't like having the air I'm exhaling going into my eyes as it's irritating, so these masks didn't work for me. Aside from the absent nose clip, they seemed like quality masks.",US,2020-08-23
3,You can blow right through them,"The face masks I make don't allow for much air to be blown through. These, you can blow a candle out when blowing through them. They are soft and comfy-, the ear loops are fairly cheap. One of them was already falling apart. That being said, they are soft and stretchy.",US,2020-07-08
3,An OK mask,"I liked the shape and style of these masks. The material is somewhat soft and comfy enough against my face for all day use. I am a bit hesitant on the type of protection these masks offer due to the material being slightly see through when I held a flash light to it. I ordered an adult large which seems to be the standard size but it's a bit loose on me. Especially when I speak for a long period of time, the mask seems to slide down my nose a bit. Would be a big plus if these masks had a nose clamp and we're a bit more fitted.",US,2020-07-29
3,Decent bur no nose bar,"Works well and convenient 3 pack. Ear loops are a little small and I'm an average size male (5' 10""). Because there is no nose bar, if you wear glasses you will fog up. For that reason I only use them for working out at the gym because they are comfortable. 3 stars only because of no nose bar.",US,2020-11-19
3,Almost perfect!,"While this fit well on my face, my wife did not have such a good fit. A 3 pack is nice, but if the masks are only needed for limited time, its better to sell a 3 pack of assorted sizes for families.",US,2020-11-30
3,There is no wire for nose,"There is no wire to tighten across the bridge of the nose, and it fits loosely. I had to tie the ear loops on the child's size to tighten it some, but it still was loose around the nose and there was a gap at the sides.",US,2020-07-15
3,Not what I expected,"I bought these because there were favorable responses from others who bought them. I wore one the day I received them and it was soft and comfortable. However, after I found I was touching my face frequently because anytime I talked the mask pulled down. There is not a nose clip to help it stay in place. I returned them the next day.",US,2020-09-04
3,Not so comfortable,"These are very soft and ""Comfortable"" based on softness alone but they are almost too soft. As a result, they tend to cling to your face to the point that it does not allow any gaps or air to flow in and around your mouth and nose.. I like the soft feel but there needs to be some sort of stiffer shell to keep it from clinging to my mouth. I can't wear them as a result and obviously cannot return now.",US,2020-09-21
3,Comfortable but not really breathable.,"Pretty comfortable mask, it's very soft and the elastic doesn't pull my ears too much. However, it's not very breathable. Although it's not as bad as some other masks, it still restricts the airflow significantly compared to no mask. Comparable to breathing through a cotton t-shirt stretched over your face.",US,2020-11-22
3,"Nice material, but SO HOT","With our family being very careful during this pandemic, I have ordered different masks for us to wear for grocery trips, etc. This mask feels great for about 3 minutes, but it is SO hot...for me, unwearable for more than 5 minutes. Too bad, since it looks and feels nice....both my son and husband agree, it‚Äôs like wearing a ski mask :(",US,2020-07-27
3,basic reuseable masks,"Ok masks, but very basic, only to be used in a pinch. No filter pocket, no adjusters for the ear loops, not even a nose wire. I have small, slender face, I was worried at first they were a little too big. They kinda fit ok, but I would feel way more comfortable with a nose wire, since that's where the gaps are.",US,2020-10-05
3,"Expected better, but not bad","This masks are are soft to the touch. But i have to say they are not comfortable as it expected i had to be fixing my mask into place various times throughout the day, and it did start to bother my ears after a few hrs. Nonetheless a good mask. Because it does feel as if it protects.",US,2021-01-14
3,I ended up returning. Masks fit small.,"I wasn‚Äôt a fan. I ended up returning these. They didn‚Äôt fit my face well. And yes I took measurements beforehand. I am a man, 5‚Äô11‚Äù. I have a reasonably sized nose and a slightly large head. I ordered the large size. This mask went from the bridge of my nose and didn‚Äôt make it under my chin.",US,2020-11-26
3,"Like all others, when speaking my chin pulls it off my nose.",I have a long face (but I wouldn't say I'm deformed or anything!) I have yet to find a mask that will stay on when I speak. I was hoping the XL would have enough height to stay on my face when I talk. It does not. My chin pulls it off my nose. Other than that it's a great mask.,US,2021-01-23
3,Those straps!,"The mask itself is fine. It's a good size and the material quality is fine, but the straps are small and weak. They barely hold the mask in place. I checked the five different styles of face masks we have and these are far and away the weakest straps plus they are put on the largest masks.",US,2020-09-16
3,way too big for 7yr old.,"Waayyy too big. Bought the youth size (Sm) for my 7 year old. It was so big, they gaped on each side away from his face. I also bought a pack size LG for myself and there is little difference between both sizes. Plus side, now myself and my husband have masks and they are very comfortable. Downside... now I have to purchase kid masks again....",US,2020-09-15
3,Sizing is wrong,"These are very nice masks. However, the sizing is pretty off. I measured according to the photos with a soft tailor measuring tape and then selected my size accordingly. It's way too big. I ordered a medium for 11 year old son (his measurements said he'd need a medium) and they are too big for him. I'm an average sized woman and they are too big on me as well. I'll probably try ordering the small size because they do seem like nice masks but it's very frustrating to have to go through the ordeal of returning them, especially right now.",US,2020-09-01
3,"Soft, comfortable, and a little big for small faces.","Big for little faces (4year old) had to add some beads to the ear elastic. 4 year old wears it so it is soft and comfortable. Very thin though and makes me think it probably is not much better than not wearing a mask. Still, at least we look compliant wearing the mandated mask.",US,2020-09-13
3,Comfort > utility,"These are super-soft, very comfortable masks (as long as you get the correct size--they run small, so most men will need an XL). However, they don't seem to provide much ""stopping power"" for coughs/sneezes (you can feel it on the outside), and they are useless if you have to wear glasses (fog city!). But if you just want a mask so that you can comply with various mask requirements, this is very comfortable.",US,2021-01-17
3,"Doesn't fit well, my glasses keep fogging up","I've been using disposable masks ever since the COVID crisis started. Decided to try some fabric masks. These don't fit my face well and the elastic around the ears seems to be weaker than it should be.

I'm going back to the disposable masks. Lesson learned.",US,2020-09-30
3,Size down,"Just FYI, I measured my face as recommended and used the sizing chart that is pictured. According to the chart, I was a medium. Just got them today (a week earlier than expected, which was nice) but they are way too big. I would definitely size down. I will have to put little rubber bands around the straps in order for them not to fall off my face. I do have a small head, but that is why I used the size chart. Bummer.",US,2020-09-13
3,Not for people with Glasses,"Overall the material and softness are good but because they do not have nose clip, there is small air opening around the nose and fog up my glasses. I would not recommend it to people who wears glasses.
Also not sure whether it is safe for Covid-19 since you have the opening around the nose.
I cannot use it and plan to return it.",US,2020-10-13
3,Worth a try,Overall they fit pretty well but after a while the material does get a little hard to breathe in but it does not fog my glasses which is important and they are comfortable. I need to shrink the one my son uses because it will not stay up on his nose but overall they are pretty decent,US,2020-07-22
3,The youth size is too short between the chin and the nose.,"I bought these for my son to use at school. He is a very small 14 year old, and they‚Äôre still too short when measured between the chin and the nose. I constantly catch him wearing it under his nose because when he talks it pops down.",US,2020-11-21
3,Meh,XL fits perfect for my face. It's definitely soft but not breathable at all. It gets very hot,US,2020-12-03
3,Weird fit,"These are a good size for teens or adults with a smaller face, but their shape seems almost molded, so that it puffs out over the nose and mouth area and looks truly bizarre and is probably an ineffective air filter. I had to return them.",US,2020-10-08
3,"The mask is good, but...",The mask is a good fit. Material is pretty thin. Often questioned if I am protected. Needs a mark to show which side is up. Would be great if a filter could be a used with the mask.,US,2020-08-17
3,Great product but straps broke after one wash,"I got this product a couple days ago and I just put them through the wash tonight. I tried them on when I first got them to see how they fit and they're so comfortable. I just wish I could have actually worn them at work. I put them through the wash and dryer exactly as its instructed but one strap on each mask snapped and broke off. I'm thinking I probably should have went with my gut and just washed them by hand instead. I would love to recommend this product but with the straps just breaking like that, they're useless.",US,2020-08-16
3,"Nicelooking and comfortable, but comes apart after a single washing",Nicelooking. Comfortable fit. But...after a single pre-wear washing...the inside layer of the double layered mask is separated from the edge of mask stitching. You need to stitch these leaving extra fabric above where you start your stitching.,US,2020-09-11
3,Comfortable but Hot,"These masks are very soft and comfortable, but they are hot and I feel the cost was a bit high. I ordered a friend these as well and she agrees that they are comfortable but hot. I would not recommend them for this reason.",US,2020-12-01
3,Move along.,I can‚Äôt wear these for long without moisture collecting inside. They are hard to breathe in. I keep going to touch it to adjust. They are made well and I got what I paid for. I just can‚Äôt wear these for any longer than a quick trip inside.,US,2020-08-17
3,Okay Project for Okay Price,"It is nice and better than the disposable masks, however it fits lose on my face and I had the impression it has a nose wire to mold to your face. In a pinch it works, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth the almost $19.00 though.",US,2020-06-11
3,More comfortable than paper; less comfortable than other cloth masks,"Material has a strange polyester feel and even after washing, smell. Was very hot when worn outside on a summer day. More comfortable than paper masks, but not nearly as comfortable as some of the cotton ""dust"" masks with carbon filters. The XL is barely large enough for my husband's face.",US,2020-07-09
3,"Good quality, sizing runs small for my medium sized face.","Mask was purchased as a response to COVID protection guidelines. Mask is well made. The sizing was an issue for me. I ordered and wanted a medium sized, adult mask which should be larger than a small. However, the mask is sized as a small/medium, no difference. The next size large/extra large would have been much too big. Although more costly for the seller and subsequently for the purchaser, I would recommend manufacturing four individual adult sizes - small, medium, large and extra large. Thank you.",US,2020-08-09
3,Update,"Update: I figured that if I turned the nose side downward to my chin, the mask would stay on. Customer service was nice.

Original: Falls off the nose when you talk, uncomfortable on the ears. I would return it for a refund if I could.",US,2020-08-03
3,"Thin, no filter pocket","These face masks fit my 11 year old very well. They have 3 layers of cloth, are soft, and light weight. He found them to be very comfortable. The problem I have with them is they seem thin, there is also no pocket for a filter.",US,2020-08-04
3,Comfortable but looking worn too soon,"These are comfortable for those who have to wear a mask all day at work. They're soft. However, they're looking worn a little too soon. I've had them about 6-7 weeks. I bought a total of 6 so each one is worn, washed, and hung to dry once a week. The fabric is looking faded. Great if you're looking for comfort but don't expect them to look like new for very long. My Old Navy masks are holding much better but aren't as comfortable.",US,2020-12-19
3,Restrict breathing,"I gave 3 stars because the are uncomfortably hot to your face and restricted my breathing.
There is no nose strip to seal tightly above the bridge of the nose to help seal the opening there. No filtration and fogs up glasses.",US,2020-08-04
3,Not so XL,"I've tired multiple masks. This one is a pretty average size. I suppose the cloth over your face is larger than normal, but the space from ear to ear is no larger than any other mask. And, there is no elasticity in the ear loops.",US,2020-07-22
3,"Too small for my big face, otherwise very nice","These masks are really good and soft and nice to wear all day. Unfortunately, they are too small for me. They fit side-to-side, but not from nose to under my chin. I was hoping that since they‚Äôre labeled as xl they would work, but they don‚Äôt.

If you don‚Äôt have a large face or beard, these would be great.",US,2020-10-23
3,Slips off nose,"Still a bit big for a teen/small adult. Daughter uses only when doing outdoor activities and needs something to put on to make those around her comfortable as we pass. I'm pretty sure this doesn't protect at all, but that's ok if outdoors.",US,2020-09-06
3,"Description says XL, I received Medium",Three quick things to note. The masks are soft. The ear loops are not adjustable. These masks do not accept carbon filters. I'm returning because the description says XL and I received Medium.,US,2020-11-20
3,So disappointed,"Ordered these masks in a large according to how to measure for this product. When received they were way too big for my face. Thought sure with virus they couldn't be returned so I washed and dried hoping they would shrink. Unfortunately for me, they did not. Superior quality, incredibly soft but still to big for my face. Still need masks for protection but now I have none.",US,2020-07-13
3,Medium: From ear to mask too large!,"Ordered for our 12-year-old son and we measured according to the chart. The actual mask fits OK Though a bit large but from ears to mask, it is way too large. That size is made for an adult or really large youth.",US,2020-08-09
3,Wont stay on my nose,"It's soft, comfortable but keeping it up on your nose is a challenge. If you do pull it up then it is almost in your eyes. Maybe a wire on the nose would help, otherwise I liked it a lot",US,2020-11-18
3,No metal nose strip,"Masks are soft and ear loops comfortable. However, the absence of metal strip means that the fit around the nose is poor thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of the mask due to a coverage gap.",US,2020-11-21
3,Check size before opening,This is my second order. The first order was great. This order contained the wrong size (smaller) and they didn't fit. I should have double checked the package before opening. Disappointing.,US,2020-12-10
3,Okay,"The masks fit well and seem good quality, but the dye is heavy and makes them stiff and not as usable as they could be with less of it. I washed them in hot water and detergent, that helped, but still would be better with less dye, or no dye.",US,2020-07-23
3,They seem to work upside down,"When you put this mask on and put the bent side over your nose, it will slip down immediately and ALL damn day. Finally I turned it upside down and put that part under my chin, and it works fine. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to work. I did like the modified size for my little narrow face (I am an old lady).",US,2020-09-03
3,"Too small for my head, thick and difficult to breath through",I have a big head. These don't fit me at all. My kids have smaller heads and since these are not adjustable don't work for them either. The material is too thick to breath through easily. I won't buy these again.,US,2020-07-29
3,Ehh,These masks are just ok. They don‚Äôt feel very secure on my face and there is no tightness on the bridge of my nose as there is no rigidity or clip. I feel like plenty of air is making it in around the edges. Probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend! Still searching for that perfect mask.,US,2020-07-20
3,No Noise Strip to form a seal and prevent steaming of your glasses,"No Noise strip to form a seal and prevent steaming of your glasses, not pointed out in their description!
I guess the are lighter because there is not steel strip LOL - not a great mask",US,2020-09-16
3,Not really smaller,"This is a perfect light weight mask. I have wear in for 12 hours and my face doesnt get irritated. I only gave three stars because I order a medium assuming the mask itself would be smaller. It appears the mask is the same size as any other mask, but the ear pieces are just shorter/tighter. I have a small face and was hoping this mask would fix the problem of me have to readjust the mask ever two seconds. It is comfortable but still takes up more than half my face when I wear it.",US,2020-11-19
3,Best for kids 4 or 5 and up,"I have three boys and These fit my 6 & 7 year old great, they are too big for my 3 year old though, and he doesn‚Äôt like it tightened around his ears to try to make it fit. So not 5 stars cause of misleading marketing.",US,2020-08-09
3,XL too big,"The XL masks are HUGE and float in my face. Not comfortable or practical. Thankfully, one of the three is a smaller size that fits reasonable well, so it wasn‚Äôt a complete loss.",US,2020-10-18
3,I had to return mine. Gives me a bad headache.,"These are Amazon Recommended, however, I found them difficult to wear for longer than 15 mins. I did follow instructions when I received them by hand washing and air drying. However, I've wore them now 4 times and each time I got a piercing headache. I am returning them.",US,2020-07-21
3,Too Small,"I took measurements prior to ordering. I measured 5.5‚Äù so I ordered Large. I should have ordered Extra Large. When I open my mouth to talk, the mask is pulled down from my nose, rendering it useless. Now I have two untouched masks which will never be used. The material is very soft and seems breathable; just be sure to order a little larger than you‚Äôd think.",US,2020-11-22
3,Works But Sizes Run Toward Small,"The masks seem well made. They are soft and easy to wear. However, I ordered what I thought would be a man's large. It did fit, but seems a bit snug. If I ordered these again, I would order a size larger than what I thought I would need.",US,2020-07-13
3,Sizes are very confusing,"Hard to figure out what size you should order or even once the product arrives, what size it is. The bag says both ""M Size"" and ""Youth/Adult Smal..."". I tried to order an adult Medium...",US,2020-12-20
3,I just can't stand the fit.,"I dunno, some people really seem to like how these masks fit, but for me even though I got the size they recommended based on my measurements it just isn't comfortable. I can't open my mouth at all or it slips uncomfortably on my my nose and chin, and it won't stay in place. It's just the wrong shape for me, I guess. It's too bad, because the material actually seems pretty nice. Maybe it'll be better for you. I can't really recommend it though.",US,2020-09-14
3,Masks Are Functional But Could Ne Better,"These fit as described and will do the job of a mask but - the synthetic material collects odors from breath to those in the environment. They don‚Äôt breathe as well as cotton material, and if you have a beard the synthetic material rises down your face as you talk - leading to constant readjustment. They‚Äôre functional but inferior to natural fibers - this the three star rating.",US,2020-09-07
3,Narrow elastic bands; buy it a size up,"Nice material inside and out, with two layers of cloth. However, the ear straps are just narrow elastic bands that look like they‚Äôd be uncomfortable pretty quickly, and the sizing chart results in too small a mask by at least a size.",US,2020-09-26
3,Too hot,They're just okay. I don't think I'd buy them again. I really wanted to wear something besides the blue doctor type masks so I got these. But honestly they can be a little uncomfortable at times and they also make me REALLY hot.,US,2020-08-08
3,Too big for me,"Unfortunately they were way too big on my face! I‚Äôm an adult woman with a slightly chubby face so that was a little disappointing. They are comfortable though, I wish they would‚Äôve worked for me!",US,2020-10-20
3,Slide around a lot,"This mask was great the first day I wore it, but now that it has stretched out, it slides all over my face. I'm also constantly having to adjust it and put it back over my nose.",US,2020-09-14
3,Super cool looking,Got these for my bf and they look really nice honestly. He did say he had a little trouble breathing compared to the medical face masks but that was the only issue!,US,2020-10-15
3,Large enough for a large face.,"Was so glad I had purchased these. Finally tried the mask and was pleasantly surprised. It was large enough, for my face. Which was half the battle. Will update after prolonged period of wearing.",US,2020-12-06
3,Could have had adjustable ear pieces,"I like the comfort and shape, but there is be nose shaping in it and ear bands not adjustable. They are good, just got them, so we will see if they hold up.",US,2020-11-05
3,"Very loose fitting, great in all other areas","My only issue with these masks is their fitting. I‚Äôm a grown man and they came very loose. As soon as I put it on my face it fell down below my chin. I couldn‚Äôt imagine them fitting properly on anyone, let alone a woman or child. My recommendation would be to cut the strap and tie it like a shoelace, then cut the excess string. Once you do this, though, the mask is great! Very comfortable, stylish and breathable. If the manufacturer can fix the sizing, this will be a great mask without any personal fixing.",US,2020-08-22
3,OK masks,They are a little loose and don't cover my nose/mouth as well as some of the other masks I have. No wire loop in the nose area to snug it down.,US,2021-01-03
3,"Not big enough for my 8"" Fitted Hat Size Head","I don't see what all the hubbub is about. $18 for three 'XL' masks and it still doesn't fit me properly. I can either cover my nose, or cover my chin - never both.

For the record I am properly an 8.25"" in fitted hat sizes, if you're familiar with that size scale. Not overly fat or anything in the face, either, I am 6'2"" 200lb.

Doesn't solve the problem I was hoping to solve.",US,2020-10-05
3,They work,I got these but gave them for my daughter to use at work. I personally don‚Äôt like how it feels on my face. Something about the fabric.,US,2020-12-28
3,Masks are different size then the first time I ordered.,I ordered the medium size a couple weeks ago and received a perfect face fitting mask since I have a relatively small face. So I ordered it again and received a much larger mask. I double checked to make sure I ordered the same size and I did. But the masks were much larger the second time.,US,2020-11-12
3,"Runs very small, large not for normal size male face.",Small does not fit my 8 yr old. Medium doesn't fit a15 yr old. Large does not fit an adult with a normal to smaller face. Now stuck with a set of small that are for a toddler and have to find larger masks for an adult face.,US,2020-12-08
3,Not bad,Not bad. I have a bigger head and ordered the XL; a bit loose on the sides. So far no issues with breathing. It does cover nose to under the chin and I have a shorter beard. Covered it well.,US,2020-11-28
3,MASKS,"I was expecting to have an adjustable wire over the nose to tighten that area but no they not have. Hopefully when I am out walking with sunglasses, my glasses won't fog up.",US,2021-01-28
3,Hard to breathe and to large,The masks are very thick which is good for protection but it does make it hard to breathe and it does fit to large from the top of the nose to my adams apple. Fits around the ears perfectly.,US,2020-08-11
3,"Okay, don't get if you wear glasses","These don't have any sort of nose bar to keep your breath from gushing right up into your eyes, so if you wear glasses these might not be the best option.",US,2020-08-20
3,Too soft,"Too soft, tickles my face and nothing to keep the hot breath up in my glasses.
I do not recommend for anyone that wears glasses.",US,2021-02-04
3,Uncomfortable,Compared to many others I have bought these are much more difficult to breath in. They are right on an adult face with stitching don the middle that is irritating,US,2020-08-24
3,Update directions,"Okay but says white side worn inside well there is no white side both sides black so what side is worn out ,I went by the picture based on how the ear straps face .They need to change their directions on how to wear them",US,2020-10-31
3,Good but terrible sizing,Ok quality and softness. Unfortunate large is not large enough XL is too big. Would be nice if they had a semi rigid nose bridge to get a better seal and keep the mask up.,US,2020-10-21
3,Sizes are diff,They are good masks but these are suppose to be for kids but they are way big. I guess i could cut the strap but i figured it would already fit a child,US,2020-08-28
3,Overinflated reviews,"I bought these masks in order to avoid using excessively the disposable kind due to concerns for the environment. The reviews were glowing, but the reality is that they are very hot to wear, after a few minutes my face is sweaty and I have to wipe around my mouth frequently. I am fortunate that I only have to wear it when a client is in my office and not all day.",US,2020-10-21
3,Great for an adult but not a kid,My kid didn‚Äôt like them. To big.,US,2020-08-12
3,Lightweight but more condensation build up around mouth,Super lightweight and comfortable. I use during weight and cardio sessions. I like this mask but it makes my face sweat more.,US,2020-12-23
3,Very comfortable,"Super soft and comfortable. Ear loops very soft. Good coverage. However, it gets quite warm to wear, and wearing most of a full day at work does get warm.",US,2020-12-27
3,Too Big,"I am a normal sized female with a normal sized head. These are too big. I guess I should have gotten the medium size. As the pandemic is getting worse, I am now double masking when I can, so will continue to use these as part of my double mask.",US,2020-12-05
3,Decent mask but not for long periods!,"This mask is pretty large and fit well on my average guy size face. However, after wearing it for almost 11 hours straight at work, I realized it‚Äôs not the best. The thin and elastic ear pieces dig in to the tops of my ear and irritate them. For extended wears I decide to switch to a similar sized mask but with thicker cloth ear loops!",US,2020-08-17
3,Needs a nose wire,"I had to add a nose wire because without it, there's a big gap. Would be nice if the ear loops were adjustable too.",US,2020-12-26
3,Comfy but hard to breathe in.,"While this mask is soft and comfortable, it is not useful for exercise. It sucks into your mouth and nose as your breathe, making it very difficult to breathe properly when breathing heavily. I used it while at the grocery store, and the mask was comfortable enough. It‚Äôs fine for everyday use, but not for running as I had hoped.",US,2021-01-13
3,Bad madk,I hate it. To big and to heaven. Hard to breath with. I only use it now if I have to spray paint. They are useless for everyday.,US,2020-10-05
3,"Rubber stretched out, poor fit","Openings around nose, etc, ear loops stretched out within the month, not ready to breathe through. Worth it to buy a higher quality.",US,2020-09-06
3,Sizing issues,The large is just too big for me-adult female.. I'm going to end up cutting the band then tying it to shorten it so it fitses snuggly.,US,2020-11-27
3,Still recovering!,"They block downward view. Tripped on curb twice & to the hard sidewalk I went. Thankfully no broken downs, but plenty od bleeding! Sent to trash!!!",US,2020-08-09
3,Thin,"You definitely should NOT use this mask in a large group, because it‚Äôs so thin. I did the lighter test, and was able to blow the lighter out with the first try. It‚Äôs probably good for a small office setting that require masks.",US,2020-09-11
3,"Well made, comfortable.",Made well. Comfortable.,US,2020-06-22
3,Straps aren‚Äôt adjustable,Cute and comfy BUT... falls off nose. The straps are not adjustable!,US,2020-07-10
3,"Fit fine, but are mostly polyester","They fit well and are comfortable at first, but then feel real hot, probably because they are mostly made out of polyester.",US,2020-07-22
3,Poor protection,2 out of the 3 masks failed the flame test. I was able to blow out a flame easily.,US,2020-09-03
3,Pretty small,"Ordered large, seemed to be the default. Next time X-large, Could double as a bra cup! That's what it reminds me of anyway.",US,2020-08-01
3,Run larger and make you a sweat,They are nice mask but run on the larger side . They also seem to keep heat in as it feels warmer on my face than other masks and makes me sweat sometimes .,US,2020-10-15
3,Great quality but inconsistent sizing.,"The masks are exactly what I wanted. My mom and I have had such a hard time finding masks that fit our faces. We were so pleased we ordered another pack in the same size but the second package of the masks were significantly bigger.. that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not rating 5 stars, so happy with the first three we ordered but sad we couldn‚Äôt get more in the same size for some reason.",US,2021-01-24
3,Worth $5.00 not $16.00,"Decent masks, but still cheaply made. Woth five bucks max. $16 for 3 masks is robbery.",US,2020-11-25
3,The aren‚Äôt comfortable,They came in different sizes even though I bought the same size. Two are smaller and so tight. They are soft though.,US,2020-10-12
3,Sizing was not consistent,"I purchased these masks for my son to use at school. I ordered a size small and one of the masks was way smaller than the other two. It barely covered his nose and mouth. They seem comfortable, but just disappointed that I basically paid this much for just two usable masks.",US,2020-09-02
3,rather not,not for me. Be better if it had the nose clip when I breath my breath comes out at the nose into my eyes,US,2020-08-12
3,Decent at best,"This product at first seems great, the issue is in the material and the string around your ears. If you wear it for long periods of time it hurts. Facial hair pulls on the materials as well",US,2020-08-19
3,Medium Quality,I would've preferred a higher quality so I wouldn't buy again.,US,2021-01-08
3,really hot,I find these make me hot in a hurry because there is limited breathability. Wash up well.,US,2020-10-09
3,Accurate sizing,These mask are good but disappointed because the large is very big. Description stated large fit most adults.,US,2020-08-04
3,Straps do not hold up,This is a very comfortable mask but I have to give it lower stars because the straps are cheap and break quickly. One arrived with a strap already nearly broken through and the same things happened to the other two after the first time I hand washed them. Too expensive for one time use.,US,2021-01-31
3,Broken straps,The ones that were not damaged worked fine. The straps were broken on several.,US,2020-10-04
3,Ear bands are too thick,"The mask was fine in terms of fit and breathability. My son dislikes masks with seams going down the middle, but I don't mind. We all agreed the biggest issue was the elastic part that goes behind the ears. It is quite thick and uncomfortable - and made of something that feels close to tshirt material. We prefer thinner elastic-type ear loops.",US,2020-09-24
3,"Comfortable, form fitting, but not easy to breath through.","Comfortable, form fitting, but not easy to breath through.",US,2021-01-05
3,"Large and comfortable, but difficult to breath through","I use these masks nearly every day and i used them at disney world. While they are comfortable, the material is not breathable and offers alot of resistance causing your breath to go out the top and steam up your glasses.

I strongly suggest a regular cloth mask instead.",US,2020-12-12
3,Not that comfortable,"Not as comfortable as I thought, but I don't wear a mask unless forced to at the few places I do shop. Wearing these definitely helps me get my shopping done faster, so I can get done and out and take this thing off. Not a fan of any masks.",US,2020-07-26
3,Disproportionate,"These are very well made, but they don‚Äôt fit well. I have 5 children ages 3-9 and they don‚Äôt fit a single one of them. If they fit comfortably across their face, they are too small to cover their mouth and nose.",US,2020-08-27
3,"Too big, no top wire to pinch over nose.","Soft and washes well.
But this is too big for my face, and there is no nose wire to pinch for a snug fit.",US,2020-12-09
3,Ear Ring very uncomfortable,They are soft but just okay for breathability. Ear peices uncomfy,US,2020-11-18
3,One of the thinnest,On the thin side...who knows if it actually works,US,2020-12-20
3,Careful what size you order,Don‚Äôt believe the size stated. The small might fit a 5-6 year old at best,US,2020-11-08
3,Sizes vary even though I ordered the same size,First set of 3 fit perfect. So I ordered a second set and they are too big. No consistency,US,2020-08-12
3,Masks are Ok,Ok for the price I thought the quality would have been better,US,2020-10-24
3,Not all the same size,"Out of 3 masks only 1 of them truly fits and stays on my face. I gave the other 2 away. They would slide down my face while speaking.

They are very comfortable, but it would be nice if they were all the same size.",US,2020-08-11
3,Buy smaller size for correct fit.,"They are loose, not cut well. I wear an xl motorcycle helmet and have a beard. These are still loose.",US,2020-11-24
3,Stretches,Stretches and then doesn't fit right.,US,2020-12-14
3,Causes face bumps,"Initially I loved wearing this mask, but after about a month of use (and daily washes) I started developing red bumps around my mouth and nose.",US,2020-12-30
3,Ineffective,These masks are soft and stretchy but they are too stretchy and thin to be effective. I would not rely on them for serious disease protection.,US,2020-08-12
3,Good quality masks,The masks are soft but i expected it to be very comfortable. One cannot wear this for consecutive 3-4 hours.,US,2020-09-13
3,Wish they were cotton.,Fits well but pretty fuzzy and slightly irritating. Not for long wear. Wish they were cotton. They‚Äôre some kind of synthetic fiber.,US,2020-11-23
3,"Very comfortable, BUT.........","This mask is very very comfortable and fits well BUT, it doesn‚Äôt prevent your glasses from fogging up. There is no wire around the nose piece to hold it down and stop this from happening",US,2020-07-22
3,To big,"They are to big, my mistake.",US,2020-12-31
3,NOT XL LIKE OTHERS,Not XL face covering. Gave to peeps with narrow face,US,2020-08-25
3,Inconsistent,I bought my first set and they fit perfectly ordered another set of XL face masks and they were smaller than my first set. * UPDATE* After posting that I had received the wrong masks they contacted me to make it right. After a couple of days I had a new set of masks at my front door and fit great.,US,2020-12-03
3,must have,"too big for me,a medium size woman,it keep slide down.",US,2020-08-09
3,Decent product,Decent product but runs pretty small,US,2020-12-04
3,Mask Cannot be washed in hot water.,The masks smell so bad they are almost nauseating.,US,2020-08-25
3,It‚Äôs ok,It‚Äôs light & comfy but doesn‚Äôt fit well.,US,2020-12-06
3,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable elastic for ears. Not what I expected.,US,2020-09-11
3,lacks metal piece for nose,Does not fit tightly around nose because it lacks metal strip.,US,2020-09-13
3,There's no nose bridge metal strip. Leaks...,There is no metal strip on the nose bridge. As a result they leak around the nose. Not sure how effective the mask really is.,US,2020-11-11
3,Good mask but sizing inconsistant,"My 5 year old seems to like these for school. I bought the small size and tied knots in the ear loops to shorten them. I ordered a second set of the same size but the newer masks are a lot larger and they don't really fit his face, even after washing them.",US,2020-11-30
3,Easily stretched too loose,Not my favorite masks. The elastic stretches out to easily.,US,2020-08-06
3,Hot and shrinks,The black mask is very hot....they tend to shrink if washed in hot water and dried in dryer !,US,2020-08-06
3,Nice but too big,"These masks would be awesome as they are soft and very breathable. However, I ordered large and its way too big for me and my husband. I'm going to keep them and adjust the ear straps with my sewing machine. I would suggest sizing down.",US,2020-08-06
3,Not extra wide. Just tall,It tall for a mask but not really xl,US,2021-01-20
3,Fairly good-does not fit full face.,"The quality of the mask is very good, however the size is far from extra large. This mask will not fit a face with a beard of any kind even one that is very short and well trimmed.",US,2020-06-27
3,Doesn't fit 5 yo or 8 yo,"Otherwise it appears to be good quality. Thicker than I'd like, washes fine.",US,2020-09-11
3,So-so. Not a good fit. Collect moisture.,Poor fit. Have to be larger for an adult.,US,2020-09-15
3,Face mask,Cheaply made,US,2021-02-02
3,Pretty good,On the whole these mask are good. As a guy the facial whiskers (even tho I shave) tend to cause the inside material to become more fuzzy and make talking hard by the stray fibers.,US,2020-11-07
3,"Overall good, but thicker than I wanted!","It is very soft & comfortable. It is a little thicker than I wanted, but it works well. It fits right, but can be hot when working.",US,2020-08-03
3,No go for glasses,No flexibility in the nose so I can't wear them with my glasses. Always pushing or pulling or breathing funny. Soft material though and night be ok without glasses.,US,2021-01-02
3,Too small,"After two washes in cold and air drying they shrunk too much and are uncomfortable pulling on my wife's ears. She bought the smalls for our pre-K son, I tied the loops and they are perfect for him at school all day.",US,2020-10-03
3,Average,I got larges and they were WAY too big for me. I put them in the wash and dryer to try and shrink them but it didnt work. I think if they fit better I would like them but I ended up throwing them out.,US,2021-01-07
3,Wish there was a filter pocket....,"These are ok, they do have 3 layers, the material is durable and the fit my husband‚Äôs face well but there is no pocket for the to add a filter.",US,2020-07-25
3,"Absolutely garbage for glasses wearers, but good otherwise.",These are not within the realm of usable if you wear glasses. They will fog your glasses up unless you push the mask up and pinch the nose WITH your glasses. Otherwise they have good airflow and are fairly comfortable.,US,2020-09-03
3,Too big second purchase,Not very happy with my second purchase. The first time I bought them they fit right. The second time they are huge. Probably won‚Äôt buy them again from here,US,2020-09-21
3,Protection and coverage are important to me,The mask is perfect to wear as a covering over a surgical mask. This mask should never be worn by itself. it is too thin and it will not protect. The same as the surgical mask we buy in the store they are thin even the 3 ply. If you purchase this mask make sure you purchase the surgical mask to wear underneath it,US,2020-07-15
3,Ear Bands Broke,"Up side: These masks are comfortable and breathable.
Downside: After 1-1/2 months of daily use, hand washing and line drying, the ear bands of one mask broke, and the other two are already showing signs of wear and tear. I guess this mask is not made for everyday wear and tear.",US,2020-09-09
3,Small for a medium.,"It was a bit small for a medium. Fortunately, it fits at chin level.",US,2020-09-30
3,Hard to breathe through,Hard to breathe through,US,2020-09-10
3,Too large,"Unfortunately, These are too big for my 5 & 7 year old kids. I tried to tie knots in the elastic but that made them too tight and uncomfortable behind the ears.",US,2020-08-08
3,Disappointed - wrong size sent,"I am disappointed: I ordered a large and was shipped a small/medium, which I didn't even realize until the other day - I'd been wondering why they were so snug. They are much too uncomfortable and I also think pretty thick for exercise.",US,2020-12-26
3,"Comfortable material, but...","Disappointed. I got these thinking they would be easier to breathe in than the traditional disposable, but it‚Äôs actually the opposite. I think there‚Äôs something missing in the design. It‚Äôs hard to breathe in.",US,2020-09-04
3,Good but could be better,Wish there was a nose clip since they fog my glasses.,US,2020-10-17
3,size is a problem,"I ordered the blue and the white mask. I like the quality. and fit.
I ordered the black masks. they were small and of different sizes. I ordered again the black mask too small again.

i would like to talk to a person to describe what i want.",US,2021-01-27
3,Sizes vary per order,"Ordered two times, one pack and then two more - the two more are substantially smaller! Like a whole size step down. Very disappointed, these are great masks and not cheap but look silly when they don't fit right.",US,2020-11-01
3,Not Comfortable,Not comfortable. Rides up and didn't realize there is no wire over the nose. Does not stay in place and would never buy again.,US,2020-12-30
3,"If you think you know your size, buy the next size up!","Tight for a fat adult man, very well made! Fits my son perfect, I would buy the xtra large next time for myself.",US,2020-07-28
3,Not COVID-19 approved,It has a weird smell and isn‚Äôt soft. Also there is no metal piece or bendable piece on bridge of nose meaning it moves as you talk and doesn‚Äôt create a tight fit,US,2020-08-05
3,Material Separates after a few days,Giving it 3 stars simply because after using for a few days the material has separated (shown in picture). Also gets sore behind the ears but it is what it is. Overall good masks if they stay together.,US,2021-02-03
3,Not what I expected,Thin material,US,2020-11-05
3,Material is not strong.,All of them already have holes in them and are now unless for us. Material is not strong at all.,US,2021-01-29
3,Size not as advertised,I followed the instructions given by the seller to order correct size. They are are much smaller than advertised. It is a struggle to cover my nose and chin. I used their measurement suggestions to order.,US,2020-11-04
3,Ear strings will stretch out,"At first these were perfect and snug. But after about 3 uses on each one, without fail, the strings around your ears will stretch out so the mask will continuously slip down off your nose as you talk.",US,2020-10-05
3,Inconsistent.,"I would love to give these masks 5 stars, because 2 out of 3 are great. But the third one has oddly shorter ear loops and pulls/rubs on your ears the point of discomfort. I wish we could return just 1.",US,2020-11-19
3,"Big mask, little ear elastics","I have a large head, so I was happy with the fit of the cloth on my face, BUT the ear loops are too small for me and cause severe pain if I wear for more than hour.",US,2020-07-16
3,Child Vs Adult,"I ordered a package of child size and adult s/m but the child-size ones were larger than the adult ones, I think they mixed up the packaging. I need to order an additional bulk order but I want to make sure they don't get mixed up again.",US,2021-01-02
3,Masks,Masks suck,US,2020-12-05
3,it‚Äôs not the worst mask out there,it‚Äôs an okay mask if you really need one. not sure if it is covid safe due to the thinness of the 3 layers (my stubble was poking through so make of that what you will.) the xl was a tad bit loose on me but after 20 minutes of running errands a seam came undone so.... yeah üò¨,US,2020-08-17
3,Wrong size,Liked the masks nice product but I received the wrong size . I had ordered large and it was a bit too big so decided on getting medium but received small instead.,US,2020-11-24
3,Not sure they will do the job,You can see thru it when you hold it up to the light,US,2020-12-01
3,Don't buy if you wear glasses.,"These masks are nice but they allow a ton of air to flow out the top of the mask so my glasses were constantly fogged. Very disappointed because I wanted a fitted, neutral colored mask.",US,2020-08-18
3,All were not the same,"Ok. Not anti-fog for glasses. If you are looking for that, skip these. They are comfortable and fit well, so if you don't wear glasses they are nice.",US,2020-08-06
3,Comfortable material,I like thicomfirtanles product; however material seems to stretch some during use and becomes too loose for my small framed face.,US,2020-12-14
3,sizing is off,"The masks are great quality, i like the shape and material, however the kids size fits me perfectly and Im a 33 year old woman. I've yet to find a mask marketed for kids that fit my 5 year old.",US,2020-08-26
3,Too bulky,Too bulky returned.,US,2020-12-28
3,"guality mask, bad ear loops.",very smooth and comfortable. But the ear loops stretched out way to easy after a 12 hr day at work. I had to tie knots in the ear loops to get them to fit again.,US,2020-07-28
3,Could improve on fitting,"Nice and soft, didn't realize they don't have a fitting on the bridge of nose so slips off a lot",US,2020-12-27
3,Will do the job,Not a fan of the ear holes but they work just fine.,US,2020-07-18
3,Too big,"Masks were really well made, but WAY too big for my 5 year old. The product description says they fit as little as 3 year olds and this is NOT the case.",US,2020-08-24
3,Not as good as expected,Same as others but more expensive.,US,2020-09-26
3,Looks like a beak,These are ok. Not a real great fit though. Makes the wearer look like they have a beak in my opinion. Real soft though. Very breathable.,US,2020-11-10
3,Good quality masks but bad earloops,"The mask is comfortable, cool and breathable. But the earloops are too thin that make my ears hurt to wear after a while. I don't think I would buy these again because of the thin earloops",US,2020-10-04
3,Fog on the Glasses,"Soft cloths, easy to wash. Breathing is ok, only problem is fog if you wear glasses. A bit annoying.",US,2020-09-18

3,Not the best but better than most,Very soft and breathable. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is after wearing the covering for a few hours (as required for my job) the ear loops start to hurt the backs of my ears.,US,2021-01-28
3,Not worth for the money.,"The masks are made from very thin fabric, not worth for the prices. Design is ok. I got size M based on the chart, but it is still very small.",US,2020-10-08

3,It's okay.,"I would give 4 stars if not for the fact that fhe sizing chart is a bit off. I used a measuring tape for the bridge of my nose to my chin and it measured out to be about 5 and a half inches. The actual mask sits just below my chin making it slip off when yawning or coughing. As far as the effectiveness of the mask. The 3 layers aren't extremely tight woven which makes the mask absolutely wearable, however my concern is that it's not offering others around me as much protection as it could. I was able to blow a flame from a lighter out roughly 6 inches from my face. It is fairly comfortable beaides being a bit small. Would definitely order a size larger than the graph indicates.",US,2020-07-09
3,THINNEST CLOTH MASK I'VE ENCOUNTERED,"This mask feels too thin. While it's undoubtedly no thinner than the blue surgical masks we're all wearing these days, it does not provide confidence; those masks at least have a built-in filter.

PROS:
- lightweight
- really provides good coverage of your face
- no gaps on the cheeks
- better protection than a bandana

CONS:
- huge gaps at the top of the mask by the eyes
- minutes after removing the mask, I can still feel where the ear loops pulled on my ears
- the mask just feels too thin
- I have no confidence that this mask is capable of protecting me.

BOTTOM LINE: If I wear this mask out of my home it's going to be with a blue surgical mask on under it.",US,2020-06-14
3,Acceptable Though Not Superior Mask,"This is a lightweight and stretchable mask that may well serve for many purposes, such as visiting the grocery store. It is relatively comfortable and you can easily breathe through it, though it can slip off the nose when talking. It is hard to tell how much protection it offers against viruses, though probably about the same level of other simple cloth masks. I was a little disappointed in the lightness of the material, and have to wonder if it will be protective enough if exposed to the coronavirus. The descriptive material that comes with the masks says only that they ""block particles,"" with no specific standard noted.",US,2020-06-21
3,"These look nice, but they get very hot on the face","These masks are well constructed and fit nicely on the face, they have that curve around the nose to make them fall a little better around the nose. They don't feel too tight or pull my ears forward.

They're double lined which is nice but they're also made of a synthetic material which is NOT very breathable. I don't mean I can't breathe, I still can, my face just gets very hot and uncomfortable pretty quickly while wearing this. They're just not the nicest to wear. I've noticed cotton masks are a lot more comfortable to have on, especially on hot days.",US,2020-07-10
3,Caveat Emptor,"Generally, I think you get what you pay for, so don't expect too much from a mask that only costs $6.33. The fit and stretchiness are okay. I am an average-sized adult male so I bought Large, which is a bit loose. Maybe it'll shrink a little when I wash it. If you are looking for 100% cotton, keep looking. The packaging indicates that the outer shell is 100% Polyester DWR (Durable Water Repellent), the middle layer is 65% Polyester & 35% Cotton, and the inner layer is 65% Polyester & 35% Cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent. Combined, the three layers of fabric are not very breathable. I have no significant difficulty inhaling through the mask, but when I exhale the mask traps a lot of the moisture, which then is forced out around the edges. Since there is no wire to form-fit the mask to your nose, a lot of the exhaust goes out the top, which fogs up my glasses. Disposable masks with the wire at the bridge of your nose are better at mitigating this effect. I can use these masks for short periods of time, like a trip to the grocery store, but I couldn't wear it for hours. It's too steamy.",US,2020-07-12
3,"Not great fit, a bit too thick for easy breathing","These are OK. The fit is a little weird even though I used the measurement guide on the product description. They are a bit bulky and not super fun to breathe thru, definitely would not want to wear these all day, but for a quick trip somewhere they work. The fabric is soft and the elastic is stretchy. Overall, I don't love the fit or feel of them, though.",US,2020-06-20
3,Prendre taille S pour enfant,"J‚Äôai suivi les. COnseilles et pris taille M pour mon fils de 8 ans c‚Äôest bcp trop grand
J‚Äôaurai du prendre du S comme j‚Äôavais pr√©vu
Le tissu est √©pais
Les lani√®res fines et laches ne semblent pas tr√®s solides et √©lastiques",France,2021-01-21
3,Comfortable but defintely cost more,Meh. For the money I think the AO saftety masks are a better tighter fit and a better deal. Granted these are more comfortable because of the wider straps. If I had to wear for 8 hours or longer I might prefer these.,US,2020-06-22
3,No nose adjustment ring,I had to return this mask although I liked the quality and comfort. Unfortunately it does not have a nose ring thus it does not allow a reasonable fit over the nose. This flaw makes the mask likely to be much less effective in filtering the air.,US,2020-07-02
3,Odd sizing,"**UPDATE - 3 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS WONDERFUL IN FIXING ISSUES....
Nice fabric. I was expecting it to be too thin but its enough for me to be comfortable with my children wearing. I bought the small/kids size for my 5 year old and 8 year old. It fits my 8 year old odd, the material in not wide enough to keep her nose covered when she talks and the bands are too loose around her ears. My 5 year old has a small face and her nose bridge is pretty flat and they don't fit at all, too big on her. I wish there was a metal wire to bend around the nose area for a better seal. There really needs to be a wire for the nose bridge with the such odd fit for both kids. The company uses a chemical on the masks that they dont disclose of untill you open the package and read everything. Very frustrating. Many people probably don't even notice. I will post pics of the ingredients that came on paper with the masks. The masks are next to a small female hand. These run very odd in size for kids.",US,2020-07-07
3,Made in USA???,"I asked for ""Made in USA"" choices. I thought that is what I was buying. This was made in Viet Nam. That's ok, but why doesn't Amazon show me the choices that I ask for?",US,2020-06-26
3,"Medium is best for an adult... overall ok, but not ideal.","I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and bought size Medium for myself, my 13 yo daughter, and my boyfriend. Not sure why they‚Äôd call
Then youth masks because they‚Äôre certainly large enough for the average sized adult. A large would‚Äôve been too big. The ear straps will probably take some getting used to as they were comfortable for about 2-3 hours then started to really hurt. We bought them for the gym and while breathable they really get like a soggy cloth sitting on my face so these are probably not for exercise.",US,2020-09-24
3,"Soft and comfortable, but keeps glasses well and truly fogged and moves around.","If it hugged tighter around the nose, this would be decent. It's super soft, the seam is made so there's a decent gap between the mask and my mouth, and doesn't pull on the ears... But as it is, the gap along the sides of my nose means practically all the air movement is through that gap and straight up my glasses. Keeps them quite throughly fogged up even with a fresh coating of anti-fog on them.

And it hooks a bit too well under the chin. One good yawn will pull it completely off my nose. I'm touching my face entirely too much while out and about, constantly rearranging the thing or holding it around my nose so I can see.",US,2020-08-01
3,Size Small for Blue too big,"We love these masks, my son is very picky so it was great that he left the white one on longer. When I saw the blue one on sale I thought it looked so cute with the color, but it's so much bigger than the size small White one. I switched him from virtual to traditional because our covid cases in our area are so much lower now, so he went back to Kindergarten which is good for him. After I washed it, we don't try things on without washing them first, that's when I realized it was too big and wouldn't fit over his nose. It just hangs down under his nose which defeats the purpose. So maybe if they make the blue ones similiar to the small white ones we would consider buying them again. Til then I guess if I need to I'll just get the small size white ones and hopefully they didn't change the size of those either.",US,2020-10-22
3,Meh.,"I purchased this particular mask (or set of three, rather) after a lengthy but unscientific search. My primary diligence consisted of being led by search engine suggestions to results as to what is ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù and ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù, and making my selections based on the reviews offered.

Being that those were my main search criteria, I feel justified in my disappointment that these masks are neither.

I had purchased these for domestic travel, and ended up swapping them out for the disposable variety.

Why am I giving them three stars? Spirit of generosity, aside; I gave them 5 stars for ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù, which grosses up the average rating to 3 stars. Yes, these masks are soft. But then again, so are socks.",US,2021-02-01
3,I would not recommend,"Pros: These masks are soft, lightweight and comfortable plus they look nice

Cons: they are thick and wearing them made me sweat so much and felt suffocating. Definitely not for using for long periods of time.

I have been looking for something I can wear for 8 hrs + for work....I loved the way these look and feel but once on, it felt like I had a sleeping bag on my face and I sweat so much and felt overheated. Guess I have to keep looking.",US,2020-09-20
3,Nicely constructed face mask,"This face mask is from Viet Nam and is well constructed and finished (unlike so many other masks from all over that are sloppy and poorly sewn). The Amazon webpage says it has a triple layer of fabric, which I can‚Äôt confirm, but will take their word for it. The fabric is fairly easy to breath through, is very soft, and dries fairly quickly after washing. One item is missing, though ‚Äî there is no metal nose wire for adjustment, so there is some exhaled leakage up into the eye area, which is not good, especially if you wear eyeglasses. If they would add a nose wire, I would give this mask a five star rating. Order fulfilment and shipment was very quick.",US,2020-09-06
3,Good for a walk/shopping..,"So the good news is this mask is great for guys like me with a big head(!) it provides full coverage over my nose and chin.. So A+ there.. HOWEVER, if you plan on working out with these you very well may struggle to breathe comfortably as it really traps all of your breath and has zero ventilation. Unfortunately, I'm still on the hunt for the perfect mask for working out. I'll keep these for shopping runs / walks etc..",US,2020-06-30
3,You Really Have to Be Careful With Size,"I ordered ""Large"" based on other personal reviews/anecdotes and now I'm returning my purchase for a refund.

Absolutely would not cover my nose without immediately falling. I had to double loop each side and basically cut off the circulation to my ears, to make it work. If it would've fit my face, I think I'd be a much bigger advocate.

I'm not really sure which measurements are helpful... but I'm 5'10 and 170 lbs. I know that doesn't really help with facial structure or measurement but... LARGE didn't work for me.",US,2020-09-01
3,"Good Size for Large Face, but not Fitted","I have a larger face and head, so most of the masks are a bit small for me. I bought this mask because it had an XL size available. The size was adequate, but it is not very well fitted since there is no nose wire reinforcement to help mold the mask to your face. The material is also very light weight and porous, so I don't think it probably isn't very effective. One plus about the material is that it does not shrink or wrinkle in the wash. Overall, it is comfortable to wear and of a decent size, but falls a bit short of my expectations.",US,2020-10-29
3,No Size Fits,"I've ordered these three times in three different sizes. I ordered the larges initially, as other masks I've tried tended to be small. The larges were quite a bit too big. Then, I ordered the mediums. There was barely any difference between the large and medium, the mediums were still slightly too big. Because of how similar the large and medium were, I figured I'd try the smalls, despite the child size listing. The pictures show the difference between the mediums and smalls. The smalls are tiny. Still don't fit. These seem like they'd be nice, but none of the sizes fit me.",US,2020-11-20
3,Quality is NOT consistent!,"After having initially been impressed, we ordered this exact same item from the same seller multiple times over the course of a few months. The first few sets of masks were great! But over time, the quality of the elastic used got cheaper! The actual size of the mask also got smaller in the newer sets we received! I can no longer recommend this item ** Update** Seller kindly sent me a replacement item, so they get 5 stars for customer service and trying to make things right. The Replacement item had same inconsistencies, but I appreciated their efforts!",US,2020-09-13
3,"Good product, but check the size","I ordered these masks because I have to fly during the pandemic. I had ordered the smallest size available on Amazon, but what I got was Extra Large. I did not have time to exchange these masks before I had to fly. Luckily, these masks are easily altered to fit with needle and thread, which is what I did. When they fit, these masks are soft, breathable, and efficient. You can test them by putting one on and blowing as hard as you can with your hand held in front of your face. I could feel the breath on my hand only when it was very close to my face.",US,2020-11-18
3,"Poor quality, inconsistent fit.","The product came sealed in a plastic package that had to be cut open which I like because it‚Äôs clean. Right out of the package one of the masks was ripping away from the seam. Each mask had different size ear loops which made for an inconsistent fit and resulting in the mask being loose and falling off my face. Other than that, the masks do seem soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, because of the poor quality and they don‚Äôt consistently fit I will be returning them.",US,2020-10-09
3,"Comfortable, thin","Nice masks but I ordered too big. Thought I needed extra large because it seems like most facemasks are too small for me, but XL was too big. I bought another set in L size and they‚Äôre perfect.

The fabric is quite thin. I can breathe very easily, which makes me wonder how effective this particular fabric is.

Quality seems durable; well-constructed. Went through the washer and dryer just fine.

Very soft on my face.",US,2020-12-14
3,"big! soft! hard to breathe, hot","I've been wearing paper masks, they work fine but are too narrow for my face. So I bought these. They are BIG! that's nice. They are made of some man made plastic-ish material that does not breathe. It holds in heat/sweat so in the winter that's nice I guess... but these things are 10x harder to breathe through than paper masks. I have one in my pocket for quick trips, but extended wear? I'd die! I would not buy it again for the reasons stated, but that's my personal opinions and usage.",US,2021-02-03
3,The Blue in Size Small Kids is actually a Medium Adult,"The mask are very comfortable and one of the only one's that my girls will wear for long periods of time. We have been testing them out so see which one would work best for when school starts back up. These hit the mark, only issue is when I went to order more and added the Blue Small size, they came in and it was definitely alot bigger than the White ones. It was actually the same size as mine that I ordered in Black Medium. Vendor needs to update sizing or ship correct sizes when ordered.",US,2020-07-07
3,"It's true your glasses do not steam up as much however, .......","It's true your glasses do not steam up as much and the ear loops are soft and stretchy so your ears are much happier that most of the masks I've seen. However, I do wonder if the porous nature of the fabric is a good thing. One of the comment I've seem re the home made cotton mask is how porous the are. Not a good thing for protecting outgoing or incoming. In reading reviews one person that claimed he could blow a candle out with his mask on. I didn't try it but I can well believe it.",US,2020-08-07
3,Soft masks,"These are nice and soft. The ability to order sizes means that ear comfort/coverage can be matched to face size so that is mighty nice - I got large which fit just right on my fat head without excessive tugging at the ears. The reason I'm only giving three stars is that they are the warmest mask I've tried thus far and that is saying something. I wouldn't want to wear one for a long time. However, as a backup that's easy to keep in the pocket, they are nice.",US,2020-09-06
3,"Just a little too big, and no nose strip.","I got these because large size masks can't handle the power of my Jay Leno chin. Unfortunately, they're just a little too big for my head. The loops hang loose on my ears, leaving coverage gaps at the cheeks and chin. The real killer is the nose area. Since the masks have no metal former at the nose, it also leaves plenty of room for air to pass there as well. I can't fault the comfort of the fabric, but without that metal former, I can't recommend these masks even for people with more prodigious noggins than my own. Wearing a mask without a nose strip is tantamount to not wearing a mask at all, y'all!",US,2020-09-16
3,Size Small Too Large For My Kids,"I orderd a package of the small for my children, 8 year old boy who is on the smaller side and a 5 year old girl who is above average for her age. The masks fit neither. Just sitting still they would fall down and expose their nose and mouth completely and they were too large for their faces. They fit my wife just fine (5'3"" 120). The label on the package states size small but possibly that is not what was placed in the package.",US,2020-08-16
3,Nice fabric. Sore ears.,"I purchased these masks because they come in a variety of sizes. After referring to the sizing chart, I clearly fell into the middle of the size large masks. The primary issue I have is not the size of the mask on the face, but the stretch on the earloops. There isn't enough. The back of my ears are sore after just a short time with these masks on. I think the manufacturer should consider adjustable ear loops or ties. Otherwise, the fabric is nice and comfortable, and they hold up well to washing. Mixed feelings.",US,2020-08-30
3,Bought a Medium.. shrunk after wash..,"Get one size up. After wash mine is unusable as it is too small for my face now.
Also, the lack of a nose wire fogs my specs. Definitely not recommended for those who wear glasses.
The only good thing about this is the softness of the material and the right length from ear to ear. Does not pull the ear after wearing for a few minutes.",US,2020-12-05
3,"Soft, too thick, hot no thin metal piece for proper nose fit",Nice color and ear lobe elastic But these are hot a little heavy and fit it a little loose because there is no sewn in thin metal piece that conforms to your nose. Had high hopes for these but will keep them as spares.,US,2020-08-21
3,Measure your face.,I figured a large would fit since the adults were ordering the large. Well they're way too loose on my face. Kind of disappointed. Don't want to return them since they would probably end up in the garbage. Should've ordered a medium. Definitely run a little big.,US,2020-07-27
3,Size matters,"This mask does not have adjustable ear loops and for the large adult size the mask was too loose. The company offered to refund my purchase but I told them I could tie knots on the loops and make them work. But had I read about the loops being large, I wouldn't have purchased them. I suggested they make adjustable loops. The mask is soft and comfortable. Just a pain to get it to fit.",US,2020-11-15
3,Nice but one of them was defective,"These are very nice masks. I bought 3 in a pack one but unfortunately one of them came ripped. üòï

I ordered small for my kids based on the review. But I should have bought medium. If you have kids 12+, order medium. Small fits my 9 year old good.",US,2021-01-17
3,not impresssed,"These are VERY small, and have a VERY pronounced nose bump out. They fit, as I have a very small face. But they would not fit most adults. There is no nose piece in them, but they seem to stay in place okay without it. They just seem quite thin and flimsy. Not sure I trust them to provide decent protection even for simple store runs.",US,2020-09-22
3,Gets hot,"The mask is well made and breathability is initially very good. I also like the thin ear straps because I wear both eye glasses and behind the ear hearing aids, so there is very little real estate behind my ears, but after a short while, especially in stores shopping or just indoors, it gets uncomfortably hot.",US,2021-01-03
3,Good mask but they run big,Seems to be a good quality mask but it runs way too big for my 3 & 5 year old kids. It‚Äôs hanging off both their faces - they only somewhat fit if I twist an extra loop on their ears. Probably better for older kids.,US,2020-08-01
3,These run small,These run small. I‚Äôm adult and ordered medium. I think most adults would need a large or XL because the small is better for youth and fits so tight there‚Äôs very little room to breathe and makes mask hot. Measure carefully and err on the next size up. They do use a comfy material. I‚Äôm giving mine away. Too tight.,US,2020-09-09
3,Too small,"The masks are smaller than we expected. We are average adults, did the measurement before ordering according to the chart in product description, but we found ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù probably fits a child better.
The material is soft and comfortable, but thin, not sure how much protection it would provide.
We washed the masks already before trying on, so we won‚Äôt return them.",US,2020-06-30
3,"Soft and comfortable, but too thin for COVID IMO","I have reusable/washable masks from three other providers and one local sewing shop. All four vary in breathability, thickness and comfort. But the material for all four is heavier and thicker than these EnerPlex masks - and 3/4 have the metal strip to conform to the bridge of your nose. These are soft and very comfortable - but no thicker than most of my tee shirts. Given the ""three ply"" description I expected something more alike all my other masks.",US,2021-01-15
3,Care of Product,"The reason for the mediocre review was the fact that the masks had to be dried flat after washing to ""avoid shrinkage"". It took two days to dry indoors even in California 87 degree weather. Prior to ordering the masks this fact was not revealed. Otherwise, the masks fit well, are super soft and arrived in a timely manner. If I had known the drying method I would have ordered more quantity to accommodate washing and drying time rotation.",US,2020-10-16
3,Good material and size but no nose wire,"The material looks good quality and the size and shape are great but... there's no nose wire. IMO a big flaw because it moves up an down. I wear glasses and the lack of nose wire causes not the seal properly around the nose, thus causing a lot of fogging on my glasses.",US,2020-10-24
3,These masks are great but NOT for someone with a very large head or wide face,"Bought these masks for someone with a large head and very wide face and they still do not fit. The masks are well made, quality material but not large enough for use for the intended person. Advertised for someone with a beard but not sure if they would work for that either.",US,2020-08-13
3,Good fit,"I am a small person and find most adult masks to be loose, so I ordered these hoping for a better fit, which I did get. However, the mask seems very thick to me and not easy to breathe through. Also, my eyeglasses tend to fog up more than with other masks.",US,2020-10-10
3,Decent masks,"Decent product. Pretty soft and comfortable. Also holds up well in the laundry. There is nothing at the top of the mask to secure it on the top of your nose, though; so I do have to pull it up quite a bit. I would suggest the maker add some sort of metal strip to help keep it secure.",US,2020-09-26
3,"These are too big for me, but my husband can use them.","These (youth size) are too big for me, 5'2'' 120 pound woman. My 6 ft tall 170 pound husband can use them, though.
The size I ordered was as according to the size chart.
But if they did fit me, they are too thick and I can't breath any how.",US,2020-07-02
3,Not as Thick as I‚Äôd Like,"I bought these based on other‚Äôs reviews. I did not like them as well as some others did. They are very thin and easy to blow through, which is a deal breaker for me. I gave them 3 stars because I will still use them by double masking.",US,2020-08-29
3,Not very cooling,"I was really looking for a mask that would be cooling. I generally get really hot under masks so I was excited to find this one for the price! Unfortunately, it's not very cooling at all, and the material doesn't really have any wicking effects besides that of normal cotton.",US,2020-09-21
3,Makes my beard itchy,I don‚Äôt know if it happens to anyone else but these makes my beard itchy. First time a mask is itchy to me. I also wanted black masks but they were out of stock. I‚Äôll just keep them but will not buy more of these.,US,2020-12-15
3,Not child sized,"I purchased these with the understanding that they would be for a child but these seem more suitable for an adolescent than a six-year-old. Quality masks, easy to put on but the sizing is just a bit off for my needs.",US,2020-10-21
3,Absolutely not breathable cotton,I love the mask...it fits perfectly but I just cannot breath in it. This is not breathable fabric at all,US,2020-09-08
3,Okay at best.,These are only okay at best. Somewhat uncomfortable straps that cut into my ears. Expensive too for what you get. I don‚Äôt expect that they will last. Hot also. There are certainly better alternative.,US,2020-08-07
3,Ear loop detached before first use.,"The fabric is very soft and comfortable. My only problem with these masks was one of the ear loops detached during my first washing, before I could even use it. That means poor quality control on the stitching.",US,2020-09-05
3,"Thin, not cotton lined. Does the job, not a great fit.","After the first wash and air dry, the elastic is loose causing mask slippage, and too much hands on time. Not what you want in Covid. Not a fan of the center seam masks after trying these, they project too far off my face. Bought a medium, I'm a petite person..maybe I would fit the kids small?",US,2020-11-01
3,Does not appear to have the waterproof layer,"The outer layer is reported to be waterproof or water resistant, but I drop water on it and is absorbed completely. The research from various sources recommend a water resistant layer. Disjointed.",US,2020-07-14
3,these should include metal strip to conform to the face,"masks are ok, but they need a metal strip to conform to the face.
otherwise air goes around the fabric and not through it, kind of defeats the purpose of wearing the mask in the first place",US,2020-08-16
3,"Good mask, terrible size guide","This is a good mask, but the size guideline is terrible. I measured my face like they recommended, and got a mask so small i'm shipping it to my 2-year-old niece.",US,2020-11-08
3,Way too big,These are super nice comfortable and breathable. My only negative is that it's huge for my 7 yo son. It fits me as an adult. Size small not sure. Wish they had an xsmall size,US,2020-08-25
3,Masks would be great if they weren't so small,"Nice fabric and decent design, but the masks are too small. I'd be adjusting it all day, which defeats the purpose. I'd go with something else, unless you have a small face.",US,2020-09-23
3,Hot,"Nice, soft fabric as advertised. Wish they added the mask is hot, a little scratchy. PS extra large isn‚Äôt extra. The esr rings are a little tight.",US,2020-11-05
3,Wouldn‚Äôt Recommend for Glasses Wearers,"They are comfortable, very breathable, and soft, but they need a nose wire. Too much air escapes out the top, which causes terrible fogging if you wear glasses like I do.",US,2020-11-04
3,An OK mask,Mask is soft and comfortable but it falls off my nose when I talk. I guess you could say it‚Äôs too small for my face even though it‚Äôs L/XL. This mask might be more appropriate for women and children.,US,2020-07-30
3,Disappointed!,"Disappointed! The size measurement for proper fit is incorrect‚Äîthe large is much larger than stated. Also, the fabric is very thin. Are these masks really three-ply thick?",US,2020-08-24
3,"Nice Masks, Too Small","These masks are considered extra large, but did not fit me (adult male, average size).

Maybe they sould offer an XXL",US,2021-01-12
3,Soft and breathable but no nose clips so they fall down all the time,I returned these because these would constantly fall under my nose so I was pulling them all the time. Too bad because they were soft and breathable.,US,2020-08-08
3,Masks are thin,"I agree with one of the reviews that said the masks are very thin. It is hard to believe that they're 3-ply. They are comfortable though, and it's easy to breathe with them on. I'm undecided about whether I'll purchase more.",US,2020-10-21
3,Will do in a pinch,"The material that goes around your ears irritated my skin, the rest of the mask was fine. Can't wear for an extended period.",US,2020-09-07
3,not a tight fit but quite comfortable,"the ear loops seem to have stretched with washing (cold water, line dry) so the masks do not fit as well as they did initially.",US,2020-09-26

3,The most comfortable masks I have put on but I can't wear them because they're an eyeglass fogger.,"There are some great points about this mask and then one that I don't love. I originally wanted masks with filters but thought I'd give these a shot because I like the shape of them. Honestly, I have purchased a few different masks It's always looking for that great fit and even without the metal piece in the top this fits very well. It is super comfortable, the most comfortable one I've tried yet. I like that it has the three layers of protection and an antimicrobial layer. I do wish it had an extra filter pocket but this seems to be fine. All of those points hit exactly where I wanted but, they're always has to be a rub.

I can't wear these because of fog my glasses up terribly. I guess it really does take that metal nose piece to redirect your breath in order to not fog up your glasses. I do hate that because again, these are so incredibly comfortable and fit so well for my average size face. If I can figure out a workaround to get these to work I will totally wear them. This will be perfect for someone who doesn't have that problem.",US,2020-06-08
3,Good for Small Faces,"These masks are not bad. Fairly well-made and comfortable to wear (if you have a small face). These fit my wife, but aren‚Äôt very comfortable for me. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô11‚Äù average-sized man, and the mask slips off if I open my mouth, and pulls my ears forward uncomfortably. There‚Äôs also a gap on each side of my nose.",US,2020-06-07
3,Runs small!,"I bought the adult small but it fits my 5 1/2 year old and 3 year old better.
These masks are soft and comfortable but when I wear them and talk they pull down and uncover my nose.
My daughter is 5 1/2 years old and with some minor adjusting of the elastic, these masks fit her perfectly!
These masks wash up great with no wear.
I would suggest ordering a size up.
I‚Äôve found that the center seam in masks isn‚Äôt the most comfortable but the materials used in these masks is very comfortable.

3,"Large, comfortable, breathable","These masks are large enough to fit big faces. The fabric is soft and these masks are double layered. The only downside is the lack of a filter pocket on the inside. These are easy to wash though, so I guess you can get by without filters if you just wash them each day. My boyfriend likes these a lot because he has problems with his sinuses and suffers from nasal polyps and these masks don't irritate his nose or limit his breathing as much as others he's tried.",US,2020-06-24
4,Breathable and reusable- just a little too loose,"These masks are great. More comfortable to breath in and they can be washed.
They are very large in size, but shrink do also in the dryer machine as stated in the package.
Overall, I'm pretty satified.",Canada,2020-07-19
4,"Soft and comfortable, but not perfect","These are by far the softest and most comfortable fabric masks I have tried. The interior is very soft and they are lightweight enough that I can keep one on for an hour without feeling suffocated like other masks. Of course they are not as light as procedure masks, but I don't think that's a reasonable expectation from a washable mask. They are also quite large, I have trouble wearing ""normal"" adult-sized masks, but these reach far down under the chin.

Now the only (and major) drawback is they don't have a nose clip. I was sometimes able to push them under my glasses to diminish fogging, but it greatly reduced the comfort, and didn't hold in place for long. I ordered and installed metal nose strips to get around this problem, but I feel they should be part of the mask, in a seam, and not just glued on.",Canada,2020-09-22
4,Best mask I've used after an easy modification.,"Bought the XL mask because I've had bad experiences with masks shrinking in the dryer.
After laundering the mask it was still big enough to fit my face.
The absence of a nose wire is the only real weakness of this mask, but the way it is designed makes adding one quite easy -- the seam on the top edge of the mask forms a tube that holds a small piece of solid copper wire quite well (I cut some from some scrap 14 gauge household electrical wire) I sanded the ends of the wire to remove any sharp edges, and was able to push them through the material into the seam, where they have been quite secure. The ends could be fixed in place with some light sewing, but I have found the bend of the wire to be adequate to keep it in position, even after washing.",Canada,2020-09-04
4,Comfortable and well designed,"We have tried several types of reusable face masks. These are our favorites. Light weight, soft, and as breathable as a mask can be. We like that they ‚Äútent‚Äù in front of nose and mouth to making breathing and talking more manageable.

After washing and air drying once they have retained their shape and size. Haven‚Äôt had them long enough to comment on durability and longevity. We have ordered more to work into our family rotation.",Canada,2020-08-15
4,Pretty breathable!,"I just ordered these since I'm now mandated to wear one at work. My boss ordered us some but it was awful for me. I couldn't breathe, the fit wasn't right and I ended up with a headache. I went searching for something else affordable but good, so I got these. All in all it's still a mask - something that restricts your breathing BUT these are really good. I noticed a major difference! I put this on and had a deep sigh out and the hot air quickly escaped. My mouth does still get wet but that's inevitable. I didn't get a headache, and overall it was great to breathe in! For someone who hates restriction, I'm glad I found something I can withstand. I gave 4 stars because I have only used it one day. Im hoping the quality keeps up because they are comfy too!!",Canada,2020-07-27
4,Great for big faces. Limited styling. Great value.,"I got the XL. I wear clothes hats and one size fits all almost always feels tight on my noggin. I use them for running errands. They‚Äôre pretty comfy. I only gave them 4 stars because the air could probably be filtered more and the styles are limited, but especially compared to other options I‚Äôve tried , they‚Äôre quite good. The best is still a handmade mask a friend gave me - scrunch-rectangle-style, but I don‚Äôt like the way it rubs against my mouth. These hold their shape and keep the fabric away better, except in heavy breathing. (But nothing that doesn‚Äôt have a structure does well there)

If you‚Äôre looking for a pre-made mask and don‚Äôt fit ‚Äúone size‚Äù items, then I recommend these. If you‚Äôre more ‚Äúaverage‚Äù sized then I‚Äôd go for something that has a nose wire or interesting pattern. But maybe that‚Äôs just a grass-is-greener reaction I‚Äôm having. These are very good.",Canada,2020-12-15
4,Best mask I've worn...with one minor issue,"These masks are the best. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was due to the fact there is no reinforcement at the nose; there's no bit of flexible metal. This means if you wear glasses, they'll fog up if you don't put your glasses over the bridge of your nose. Other then that, they are perfect. I'm 6'3, 230, so most masks don't fit on my face...these are the only ones that do. They definitely pass the ""candle"" test.",Canada,2020-11-02
4,"Good face coverings, but filtration is lacking","My wife asked me to buy these face masks for her so that she could go shipping during covid. I offered her proper N95/KN95 masks from my work, but she didn't like the look of them and found them too restrictive (I did tell her the restrictiveness was because they were actually filtering, but she still didn't like them).

She finds these masks comfortable, both around the face area and the ear loops, and finds they don't cause too much resistance to breathing (and therefore don't filter all that well). They are easy to clean, as you just throw them in the washing machine and air dry them. The three pack is convenient because she keeps one in her purse and one in each of our cars.",Canada,2020-12-29
4,Fits my husbands large face!,"Bought these for my husband because he complains other masks we have purchased are simply too small. These fit him perfectly an comfortably.
no complaints at all. He says they are comfortable enough to do his exercises and still have the mask on if he needed to.",Canada,2020-08-05
4,"Good, but had to flip it","So after a few months of use, the cotton side of the mask started to have some fibers sticking out from all the washes. Since the little fibers tickles my nose too much, I had to flip it and have the polyester side for the inside because there are no tiny fibers sticking out from that side. Luckily these masks fits my face and ear well and is pretty comfortable. I use these all day at work and only really take them off for lunch and to sip on my coffee/tea. Though I don't really recommend working out with these on, as a lot of condensation and moister builds up quickly if you are breathing heavily.",Canada,2020-11-22
4,Excellent 3 ply non medical masks!,"The first thing that I noticed is how comfortable and soft these masks are. The second thing is how well they fit. I actually bought a 3 pack in large size and a 3 pack in medium for other members in the house. I did not find any issues surrounding difficulty in breathing with the masks on. The manufacturer has gone through great lengths to illustrate on the product description page as to how to measure your face so you can order the correct size. This is what I did and they fit perfectly! Although, I wasn't too keen on spending this much money on masks, I think it was the right decision given the way things are going.",Canada,2020-11-12
4,"They're okay, but mine a bit loose...","My masks arrived on time, and I like them except for the fact they don't fit my face properly despite the fact I measured my face as shown on the page. I got a medium, but the lower part of mask is loose around the chin. I ended up tying a knot in the mask's ear loops which helped a bit. I have a smaller lower part of face, small nose, and maybe that's why it doesn't fit? Washed well, air dried them. One got into my dryer accidentally and it didn't appear to shrink (damn)! I might have to sew them to adjust, and I hate sewing.",Canada,2020-10-21
4,very good,"i bought these because they had a lot of good reviews. i also really like these. very comfortable, feels nice on my face. The shape of them is very nice. i bought a large, it fits well. my bf wasn't a huge fan because he said it always comes down off his nose when he talks. i find all masks do that tho. but these are much much better then a lot of others i have used.",Canada,2020-12-11
4,Already bought more,"These were a little big for me. ""one size fits all"" masks are too small, so I thought these would do, but they're just a touch too big. bad says to avoid shrinking do not tumble dry, so I'll try that and see.

Even being a bit too big they fit nicer than a lot of the masks I've tried. I'm a glasses wearer and it's been frustrating, but these are a big step in the right direction. Already ordered another 3 in Large and 3 in medium",Canada,2020-12-04
4,Almost perfect but I missed looking for this specific item in it,"Ok, these are super soft, light and comfortable. BUT as a wearer of glasses I should have made sure that the nose piece/cover part had a wire in it to try and stop exhaling from exiting upwards and thus fogging my glasses. I have an anti-for glasses wipe that I also bought on Amazon that I will try once I get these washed before use as per the instructions.",Canada,2020-10-26
4,Comfy that doesn‚Äôt touch lips. Needs metal nose piece.,"I had to order masks for ironworkers and welders for construction due to covid restrictions put in place by general contractors and AHS. I ordered 7 different kinds and this one is a contender.

The contour is good to the mask. A yawn doesn‚Äôt make it fall off (I did order XL which seems baggy so going to try Large) doesn‚Äôt hurt the ears. Doesn‚Äôt touch lips when breathing.

It is missing a metal nose piece though. It would be great and most likely make it easier and not fog as bad for glasses.

It is 3 layers which is what I am looking.",Canada,2021-01-08
4,Super pour une personne qui a un gros visage.,"Seul b√©mol il n‚Äôy a pas de pince de m√©tal pour adapter autour du nez et sous les yeux.
Mon mari a des lunettes et c‚Äôest n√©cessaire pour lui d‚Äôavoir cette pince pour √©viter la bu√©e dans les lunettes.
J‚Äôai d√ª acheter des languettes de m√©tal autocollantes qu‚Äôon trouve chez Amazon que j‚Äôai pu coller √† l‚Äôext√©rieur du masque.",Canada,2020-08-28
4,Not too bad at all.,"Just got these today, delivered in less than 24 hours after I ordered them. These are comfortable, albeit just a touch to big on my face (I ordered large size), but using one of those plastic mask holders that goes around the back of the neck solves the issue. They are soft, comfortable and breathable. I would recommend these.",Canada,2020-11-07
4,"I like them, my wife does not",I find they are very comfortable however breathing can be hard in some cases. Good quality. Overall I like them quite a bit so I bought my wife a set and she is unable to wear them for long periods due to the breathing aspect. On a positive note this might give them a higher degree of protectiveness. 4/5.,Canada,2020-12-20
4,Almost perfect,"They are a touch loose on my face even though they are really comfortable so I wish they had adjustable straps, but I tied a little knot in both so they work well. They did slide off my nose when I opened my mouth ( my chin would pull it down) so I actually flip them upside down and I find they stay in place much better. Overall though very happy.",Canada,2021-02-05
4,Not made in Canada,"Not sure why we need to import such masks easy to make here, the answer is simple, vendors make a tons of money. The quality is normal, the elastic string will probably break soon and the coverage is good. Save the carbon foot print as they say, buy localy is the remedy for local economy.",Canada,2021-01-10
4,Glasses still fog up,"seems durable and comfortable, but needs a metal stiffener attached to mold the edge to your facial contours. I used a copper wire with a bit of sewing to attach it. It would have been nice to have a pocket available to simply slide the wire into. With this addition it works very well",Canada,2020-12-31
4,Thumbs Up!,"The only thing that kept me from putting 5 stars is the fact that there is no nose wire - and for someone with glasses, I find I fog up more without that little feature.
The rest of the non-glasses-wearing members of my family love these masks though and I ended up ordering quite a few more for everyone! I totally recommend.",Canada,2020-09-03
4,Very soft and lightweight,"Exactly as described and would be fantastic for me except that it has no metal shaping form for the nose and when you wear glasses as I do it makes the glasses fogging problem even worse! If there were an option to have one with the metal in the nose area I would give it a 5/5 easily, as it is the most comfortable mask I have even worn, lightweight and extremely soft, almost like not wearing one at all. The match test passed.",Canada,2020-10-12
4,Comfortable but still fogs my glasses.,"Very comfortable. Its larger than the face mask I usually use. It covers your chin and nose easily.
I find that I don't have to adjust it to fit like my other face mask. Once you put it on stays put.
Its breathable but only complaint it fogs my glasses.",Canada,2021-01-22
4,Very comfortable masks,"These masks are very soft and comfortable to wear. I‚Äôm an adult woman with a very small face, and so bought the M size. They could be a little smaller still. I love the fabric though and I also like the look of the solid black mask. If we have to wear masks, they may as well be classy !",Canada,2020-09-04
4,Great quality,Great quality but again a wee bit small for a male to wear. I keep pulling the mask down over my chin and because I wear glasses they have a tendency to fog up when outdoors and more so in an air conditioned indoor environment. One day I will find the perfect ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù mask.,Canada,2020-08-12
4,Do what they are supposed to do,"They are soft, comfortable to wear and do not restrict your breathing. I bought the biggest size and they fit my face well, which most masks do not. These should fit even the fullest of faces and heads without looking like a ""post-it&dental-floss"" over your mouth and nose.",Canada,2020-09-16
4,Great masks.,"I bought these as they were advertised as three-ply and reusable. They appeared to be highly reviewed and the price was not awful, but not exactly a bargain either. They are indeed comfortable, light, and I don't feel like I'm suffocating when I'm wearing one. The fitment is just right, even without a nose-piece. Unfortunately, there was a small tear on the seam of one of the masks that I did not notice until after I had opened the package and washed them. It's possible I may have caused this, but to anyone reading this review, learn from my mistakes... Inspect them very carefully before you open the bag!",Canada,2020-11-30
4,good masks. Like so far.,Better than expected. I was using the disposable ones but found that they would slip up my face while I was working. These don't do that. They are comfortable and stay put. Only issue is I paid $17 for 3 last week and this week it went up for $26???,Canada,2020-09-27
4,Very comfortable and great breathability,"Bought the L and fits well. The elastics for the ear loops are soft and very comfortable. I struggled with other 100% cotton masks as they were too restricting in breathability for me and absorbed too much moisture. These are much better.

Only downside is that one of the masks had some dirt on the inside which was weird. So I highly recommend washing them thoroughly before wearing.",Canada,2020-08-28
4,Soft on the skin and breathable.,This mask is really comfortable and breathable. Good to prevent acne. Traiditional surgical masks are so bad at causing acne due to the material. But this material is soft on the skin. I got a large but I should have purchased a medium. Otherwise it's a good mask.,Canada,2021-01-07
4,Pretty good,It‚Äôs light and very comfortable however it could use some kind of nose piece to reduce breathing escaping from the gap. I wear glasses and exhaling causes some fogging of my lenses. Adjusting the mask can reduce but not eliminate the problem. Still it‚Äôs a very good and comfortable mask,Canada,2020-09-04
4,Great masks with only a single small issue.,"Excellent mask, comfortable and appears to be fairly durable construction, also nice its available in larger sized, only reason this didn't get 5 stars is there is a central raised seam running dead center down the middle of the inside of the mask which rest on the tip of your nose, its a little irritating at first but once you get used to it or wear it a bit to one side its no issue. Great product overall.",Canada,2020-08-26
4,I would recommend these,"So far so good. They are quite comfortable and actually feel better than I expected when I got them. The ear straps are a little thin and I'm not sure how they will hold up in the long run after a few washings, but so far I like them.",Canada,2020-12-19
4,I had no idea I had such bad breath!,"Finally, a mask that fits my giant, misshapen noggin.
Covid 19 has been positively a boon for us hideously ugly people.
Children no longer point at me, scream and run away - so long as I am wearing my Enerplex Premium XL mask!",Canada,2020-10-20
4,Good value product as advertised,I‚Äôm a flight attendant so I need to wear the mask all day I found by days end my ears were hurting but if you are just needing it for running in and out of stores etc. They would be great just not for a 12 hour work day,Canada,2020-11-16
4,A perfectly fine mask.,"Well-constructed. Good microfiber materials, very sturdy. My glasses still get fogged up and the ear loops get tangled in my hearing aid. I wear it for the good of my neighbors but not for pleasure.",Canada,2021-01-20
4,Decent face mask,"A pretty decent face mask, super soft and is very light weight on the face which is great. Only complaint is that one strap on one of the masks is shorter then the other and it causes my ear to become irritated, But overall it does what it needs to do.",Canada,2020-11-09
4,Good mask!,"They are really good masks, but still too big for my 13 year old. (she‚Äôs very petite!). I wear it and really like how it fits on my face.",Canada,2020-07-27
4,Recommended,These are extremely comfortable and well fitting masks. I bought the small adult/youth size and they fit perfectly. They do not have a filter pocket but are made with several layers of cotton.,Canada,2020-12-10
4,"Overpriced, but good quality","These are good masks. But are not surgical quality. They are well-made, but are overpriced for what you get. I wanted some durability, and these seem to be OK. Will review again if they fall apart.",Canada,2020-10-12
4,Great Masks,"Good quality so far, have gone through the wash 2x. Ear loops are decent comfort for a few hours. Breathable and have used at the gym as well. No mask is going to be perfect, 4/5 stars so far.",Canada,2020-11-16
4,"Comfy, roomy fit and feel.","Comfortable fit for my big head. Hand washes easily and dries well too. Material somewhat thin and stretchy, but easy to breath through. I‚Äôd recommend them. Not sure how effective it is, however.",Canada,2020-08-09

Pour le prix ces un bon produit!,Canada,2020-12-09
4,Very soft and comfortable,"I really like the comfort and soft material these mask are made of. However the nose does not have a fastener to make it more secure. But again they are super comfy, light weight and breathable",Canada,2021-01-03
4,Very comfortable,Very soft and comfortable on the face. The only thing it really needs is adjustable metal on the nose part. It does slide down a bit and fogs up my glasses. A nose clip would solve this.,Canada,2020-11-18
4,Good Quality - Fast Delivery,"I like the fact that it is three ply and re-usable. Appears to be of good quality, uncertain the useful life of the mask.
Would recommend the product as a non-medical mask. Quite comfortable to use.",Canada,2020-08-14
4,Good Masks,"I am overall pleased with these masks. The inside is soft and feels nice on the skin, and the fabric breathes well. I found my glasses still fogged, but that's normal for any mask I've worn.",Canada,2020-09-25
4,"They fit, the XL that is",So while they state it's XL I'd say not quiet. But they are the dimensions listed. they are soft and with an additional metal nose piece you can get a really good seal.,Canada,2020-10-02
4,Great quality but was too big for 3.5 yr old,"Got these for my 3.5 yr old son but they ended up being a touch too large on him. The elastic that goes around the ears was too large also so I had to hand stitch it a bit smaller. Other than that, they are really soft and seem like the wrap around my son's face well.",Canada,2020-08-22
4,Great masks but variable size,"These are great masks. Very comfortable and easy to breathe through. I would have given them 5 stars but they are expensive and one pack of large face masks I bought contained a small mask. So I actually received 2 large and a small in a pack that should have been 3 large.
I have since washed them and they do shrink significantly. I would purchase XL next time for my family of adults and teenagers.",Canada,2020-08-31
4,"Great mask, ear loops need adjusting","Good mask, only problem would be the ear loops are massive. They didn't fit anyone in my family, so we tied knots a third of the way down the loops and it solved the problem.",Canada,2020-10-18
4,Not what I would describe as XL but good otherwise.,"Well made. Reasonably comfortable and breathable. More like a size Large than XL, ear elastics too tight and not adjustable. No metal nose bar so glasses fog up.",Canada,2020-12-14
4,Comfortable!,I am very impressed by how this mask fits my face. I have found a lot of other masks are very large and tend to hang off of my face. The material is great for my line of work. My only complaint is that they do not keep my glasses from fogging up.,Canada,2020-11-26
4,Wish there was a nose bridge.,Good quality and size. I wish they had a nose bridge to help prevent glasses from fogging. I purchased adhesive nose bridges and colored them with black nail polish.,Canada,2020-09-16
4,"A little too big, but overall great!","These were a little to big for my face (I ordered the adult size, Large), but they are very comfortable and soft. I would definitely recommend for a man or someone with a bigger face, and for everyone else, order a smaller size.",Canada,2020-08-18
4,Good masks for the price,"As masks go, these are pretty good. I found that long wearing does become somewhat uncomfortable and does cause glasses to fog up when in many stores, but all of that is rather minor stuff. A satisfactory product, I would say.",Canada,2020-10-09
4,Best facemasks I've found so far,"Very soft, elastic loops perfect size, shaped just right. Washes well. Still a little difficult to breathe through, but overall, the best I've found so far.",Canada,2020-09-24
4,"Soft material ,but shrunk","I purchased them for a funeral ,but I couldn't wear them .They shrunk in the was . Material was soft. I ordered 2 sizes . I did use the larger size.",Canada,2021-01-11
4,"A comfortable, basic mask","The mask is comfortable and easy to breathe through. The XL would be better with adjustable ear loops so I had to re-order getting L and will work on finding a way to adjust the loops. Including a wired piece along the top would make it fit better but as is, it is not a bad mask and I use it daily.",Canada,2020-12-08
4,Does The Job,"I originally ordered Large based on their measuring, but found the Large just a bit too small. I returned them and orded these Extra Large. These fit just fine. Seem well made to me. Can't complain. I'd recommend them.",Canada,2020-09-08
4,Good fit.,"Go by the sizing chart, good fit for my kids aged 11 & 14, will have to go a to the smaller size for my 9 year old, just a tad big, but they indicate they are comfortable and breathable.",Canada,2020-08-12
4,size,They have different sizes which is nice .They do not have inside pocket for a filter and do not have a nose wire. They are comfortable and fit well.,Canada,2020-09-08
4,Almost 5 stars,"I would prefer that they came with adjustable straps, as they fit me slightly loosely. Stole some strap adjusters from some old masks and that helps them fit my face (including my beard) better.",Canada,2021-01-26
4,Awesome,"Got these for my family, everyone is really loving them. Only downside is it can get very hot in the mask!! Sweat is a problem occasionally but mostly fine. My sister has glasses and they still worked fine for her, comfy and didn‚Äôt act up in the wash. Perfect!",Canada,2020-09-01
4,Good,They don't actually shrink much in the dryer! Immediately lost one to the dryer elves after its first use... Considering more affordable masks considering that.,Canada,2020-08-26
4,"Nice quality, but hot.","Nice quality and comfort. Very hot though. Will be good for winter, but in the summer, your face starts sweating as soon as you put it on.",Canada,2020-09-20
4,Comfortable fit,Generally they seem pretty good and comfortable enough to wear. Occasionally can feel a bit sweaty probably due to the polyester and how much exertion before putting the mask on. Instructions are to wash cold. I wash under the tap after each use and then dry. They have remained sturdy so far,Canada,2020-10-21
4,"Decent quality overall, not good for glasses","Have hand washed them a few times each and they seem to be holding up fairly well. Not good to use with glasses, they immediately fog up.",Canada,2020-10-13
4,Fits Well,This is the first mask I tried that actually fits well. It is a good value for the money invested. I'm thankful that it sold as a set of three.,Canada,2020-09-25
4,Comfortable for beards!,The XL size worked good for my large beard. It‚Äôs a wider width compared to the standard COVID surgical mask so it doesn‚Äôt squish your beard. Masks are a light-medium thick material that‚Äôs quite soft and comfortable. Slightly warm so best suited for winter.,Canada,2020-12-15
4,A very warm/hot high quality mask,The quality is high and the comfort is as well. The issue I have is it‚Äôs HOT. It build up a moisture pocket where you‚Äôre breathing. Would need to be washed every time it‚Äôs used I would think. By hand I would suggest as well.,Canada,2020-09-18
4,Doesn't fit all face shapes,"I like the material thickness and feel. One improvement could be the nose bridge. Having a form fitting piece would make up for how it doesn't jive with my face shape as it keeps slipping off my nose. You're thinking maybe it's the size, but nope, the mask fits great everywhere else!",Canada,2020-10-08
4,Ignore my previous review,"So now I feel bad. I made a review for these masks but it was meant for a different one. These ones are nice. There's no wire to shape around the nose - a pro and con.
Easy to clean.
Soft.",Canada,2020-08-01
4,Fits a bigger face but material is thick - harder to breath,The size is certainly XL but it is abit thick which makes it harder to breath in comparison to the non medical blue masks that are not reusable,Canada,2020-09-04
4,large masks,"These are very large masks, my husband is a large man and masks are to large for him. Otherwise they seem decent.",Canada,2020-11-23
4,Good shape but way Too tight,"Shape and material is good. Elastic is not adjustable plus it‚Äôs way to short so it hurt my ears right away although I ordered Large size. It gives me headache.
Delivery is fast, same day!",Canada,2020-10-02
4,Comfortable to wear,Wears really nice but every extra layer makes it that harder to breath. Good for low endurance people but hard on those that have physically demanding jobs,Canada,2021-01-13
4,Good quality,"Good quality construction, quick shipping. I went off of the size chart, but even after washing and drying at high heat, they still feel a bit loose. I tied a knot in the ear loops, which made for a much snugger fit.",Canada,2020-08-20
4,Runs large,"I like the material and softness but despite taking measurements as instructed, my face mask is too big. The lack of a nose band & adjustable ear elastics makes this purchase unusable for meüôÅ",Canada,2020-08-30
4,Great masks but inconsistent elastic length.,"The first time I purchased this it was the perfect size and fit. Very comfortable and soft. My second order was good, but the ear elastic was larger making my mask more prone to sliding down. Overall still a positive experience with these masks.",Canada,2020-10-28
4,It is large...just not beard large.,"The material is soft and comfortable. My only challenge with this is that even though it says XL...and it would fit my larger face, it does not work well if you have a beard.
If you have a beard, this won't be the best product.

I would have preferred adjustable straps",Canada,2020-08-06
4,"Good quality,lightweight,some exceptions",The fit is not as good as I expected.The fit at the top of the nose is a little loose.I would like to see an adjustable nose piece.I would liked to have more specific instructions regarding # of times you use the mask before it needs to be washed.The supplier vaguely answered those questions.,Canada,2020-08-27
4,Comfortable face mask,"Excellent masks that are comfortable to wear and can be washed easily, as always very quick delivery times with Amazon.",Canada,2020-08-06
4,Bien et confortable,"Confortable. Cependant, vu l‚Äô√©paisseur du tissu, cela cr√©e un peu de bu√©e dans les lunettes. Malgr√© cela, ce sont les meilleurs que j‚Äôai √† la maison.",Canada,2020-09-05
4,Nice soft mask,Nice and soft on your face and comfortable to wear Size was bigger than expected I would buy a smaller size vs the one recommended large is too big,Canada,2020-09-25

4,For the big face or bearded,"Just a comfortable fit for me, as I have a big face and beard. Passes my fit test and is very comfortable.",Canada,2020-08-14
4,Comfortable fit.,"Not quite as breathable as I was hoping for, but then again, maybe no face mask is! Still, I use it all the time, it's easy to wash and comfortable. Worth the money.",Canada,2020-09-10
4,Comfy for Offensive Lineman or D-end.,Mask is very comfortable for a man with a big smile and an extra chin. Fabric is soft but quite heavy so it gets rather warm and stuffy in there.,Canada,2020-11-17
4,Works as advertised,"This is a simple mask. It fits over my beard well enough. The elastics are small, seem flimsy, but I hand wash them, and many weeks in with regular use, these masks are holding up well",Canada,2020-11-21
4,Bigger than expected,"Be careful of the sizing, I got XL and they are to big, other than that they are great",Canada,2020-09-22
4,"Good masks, could be more breathable","Large size fits perfectly, I was expecting the masks to be more breathable for sport",Canada,2021-01-22
4,Very nice reusable mask,Very nice reusable mask. I know it comes in different sizes but an adjustable strap would have been great.,Canada,2020-10-04
4,Sizing is a bit wierd.,"Large is bit too small and XL feels massive..

Otherwise they are great!",Canada,2021-01-12
4,easier to breathe,These are easier to breathe with but still not what you can call comfortable if you have COPD,Canada,2020-08-16
4,Soft comfortable and effective!,"Great masks! They‚Äôre SO comfortable on the face, soft on the skin, fit perfectly over nose and mouth. I love love love them! Only downside and reason why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is they‚Äôre a little tight on the ears. But overall amazing.",Canada,2020-09-21
4,Excellent Mask,"The mask doesn‚Äôt have a nose wire or inside pocket, but still an excellent comfortable mask. Size choice is great. True fit according to measurements. Purchased an XL ‚Äî finally a mask that fits hubby‚Äôs big head!",Canada,2020-10-26
4,Shoulda ordered XL,"Shoulda ordered XL. Everyone made these sound huge but they are average size, definitely measure yourself",Canada,2020-08-20
4,Okay mask,"Not bad not really soft a bit too much fabric on inside layer too close to mouth, very humid",Canada,2020-10-25
4,Just like the photo,"I would have given these masks a 5 but they were a bit uncomfortable yesterday...BUT it may have been a sizing issue. I ordered a youth and I maybe should have ordered a small.

Overall, really nice looking and light weight and came on time.",Canada,2020-10-01
4,Comfortable on the skin and breathable enough,Very comfortable on the skin. Thick enough to filter without embedding air flow too much.,Canada,2020-09-11
4,Comfortable and well shaped,Overall this mask is comfortable and washed and died with no issues (air dried flat as recommended) I am of average size and the mask fits perfectly but I advise to air dry to avoid shrinkage and perhaps ruin the fit.,Canada,2020-10-24
4,Great Fit,"I was worried about how it would fit, however it ended up fitting nicely. Would be better if there was a wire nose piece however, it's still works fine without it. Has really soft material and great breathability. I can wear it for long periods of time.",Canada,2020-09-17
4,very soft,The masks are very soft and comfortable to wear. They fit myself and my young adult daughter perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because my glasses do fog when i wear them.,Canada,2020-12-04
4,Good value for the price,Its a good product for someone with no glasses unlike me... A metal strip wouldve been an added plus to the product.. Its an ok product in warm weather... Hasnt been cold enough to see if its still as effective. But for quality vs price Id recommand it.,Canada,2020-09-04
4,As Advertised,"As advertised, worn daily with no issues. Pleased with purchase. Never give out 5 stars as everything can be improved; this product likely deserves 5 stars.",Canada,2020-09-08
4,Reasonably good quality for the price,Acceptable quality for the price. I bought large but kinda feel XL would have been a better fit.,Canada,2020-08-31

4,Decent,"Looks nice, quality is ok; for the price I would have expected a more robust mask.",Canada,2020-10-26
4,Better option compared to most fabric masks.,"I like them, not as breathable as I thought they would be though. In comparison to other cloth masks, I do find it a bit easier to breathe. I like the style and comfort of them though for sure!",Canada,2020-12-23
4,Pretty decent mask.,They fit well and seem thick enough. Make sure you wash them first since they have a manufacturing odor.,Canada,2020-09-25
4,great,Purchase this for a male. Fits great. Material is good. XL size is correct.,Canada,2020-09-07
4,Soft and Breathable,These are good quality masks. I had to sew the straps a bit for my teenage daughter as they were a bit loose for her. They fit me just fine.,Canada,2020-10-19

4,"Masks suck, but these are ok",So far these are the best I have found. when you breath they don't suck in and the material is nice on the face. Wish they had more colors.,Canada,2020-12-30
4,Bought these twice.,"Comfortable and nice looking fit. I bought a pack, lost 2 of them and then re-bought a second pack because I liked them.",Canada,2020-08-22

4,Very good masks,"These are fairly comfortable masks that aren't extremely difficult to breathe through, which is nice as many really make it difficult with the heat. The XL is very big, and ideal for very large people or those with very big noses, or even if you need a bit more breathing room at the front. They are well stitched without loose threads or visible defects.
They're soft, and easy to wash and clean. They do pass the flame test (you can't blow out fire), so ideal to stop sneezes and spittle, too.
The price is a bit high, but they are decent masks, and black is simple and matches pretty much anything.
**P.S: Don't forget to wash them in hot, soapy water after -every- use! **",Canada,2020-07-26
4,"Great set of high quality, breathable masks","I've been very happy with this set of 3 masks. Love that it comes in different sizes to get that perfect fit. The mask sizing chart is quite accurate as well. The masks themselves are made of high quality fabrics, very breathable and comfortable to wear. Unlike some other cloth masks I've used, I don't find this causes my glasses to fog up and also doesn't make me feel like I'm suffocating. I like the black design, it's got a clean look overall. For the money, this set of 3 is a really great value. Would recommend!",Canada,2020-07-22
4,comfortable fit,"These masks are among some of the more comfortable ones that I've tried to wear so far, the interior layer feels soft against the face and the ear loops can be tied to make the mask fit tightly around the face. The fabric is easy to breathe through without allowing particulates to travel far from the face. The only issue I've had with this design is that it is somewhat easy for the mask to pop inside out so I always have to double check how I am putting it on.",Canada,2020-09-23
4,Good mask,"I like the portability of this mask. I carry it in my pocket and put it on when I need to. I did the measurement and determined that a ""large"" was the right size. What I've found is maybe because I have a short beard, the mask does not stay up, especially when talking. It also fogs up my glasses. I'm thinking of ordering an XL, maybe that will work better for my beard??",Canada,2020-12-01
4,"Fits my face, comfortable","This mask fits well, and is comfortable and easy to put on one handed. I found it seals well as is, but can be improved with a self adhesive aluminium nose strip. Very easy to breath through, so I don't know how effectively it is filtering anything, but better than nothing and these are easy to carry in a pocket - in a sealed bag.",Canada,2020-07-23
4,Extremely Comfortable,"The EnerPlex Face Masks are extremely comfortable to wear and easy to breath through.
They are easy to wash and dry.

The only drawback is I would like to see them a little less expensive.",Canada,2020-07-30
4,Decent masks...,"These are decent masks, though they do pill quite readily in the washer.

Overall, they're comfortable and fairly well made.

Recommended.",Canada,2021-01-25
4,Get the XL mask- L is too tight,"The L size of the mask is tight around the ears, which bothers me. Since you can't return it, I'm stuck with it. But if I were to buy them again, which I might, I'll definitely go with the XL mask. I'm 5'8, for size reference.",Canada,2021-01-27
4,I love these masks,I ordered a size medium and I am a woman. these masks are really comfortable. The only drawback I noticed is that the inside can easily collect dust. I use a lint roller though.,Canada,2020-09-16
4,Very good but not the best,Very comfortable but you can actually blow through it. That's probably why it's so breathable. If you want something more protective maybe look somewhere else but if you want something casual this is good.,Canada,2020-08-16
4,I ordered a large however still a bit small and does not totally cover both mouth and nose.,Too small . Easy to breath.,Canada,2020-12-13
4,Good for everyday use,These are very comfortable and work well. They do stretch a little over time and pill when you wash them which is why I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5.,Canada,2020-12-20

4,"XL: Not ideal, but much better than other options","I just the got the XL facemasks in. They could still use to be a bit bigger. The nose section will come off when talking/yawning and the elastic is a bit of a stretch to get around your ears and feels quite thin. these are still going to hurt to wear for long stretches, but better than any other option that I've tried. If you have a big head/face, this is probably your best bet.",US,2020-06-21
4,"Good mask, ear straps uncomfortable","We ordered a package of small for my two youngest children (6 and 11, both petite) and medium for my son and myself (13 and petite adult). The mask fit well along our faces--we like that it dips down a little so that we could see some of our cheeks, and they look very nice. But the ear straps didn't fit well. They're a little on the longer side, and after tightening them a little by twisting them or putting a knot, they dig into the back of our ears. These will work well for shorter periods but we probably can't wear these all day.",US,2020-08-01
4,"Not 100% cotton, but a poly/cotton blend","The masks are generously cut and sized, the fabric was nice, and they fit much better than the common ""one size fits all"" products available. The one disappointment was the polyester blend fabric. It's not as easy to breathe through and I find my face starting to perspire and getting hot after a few minutes. This may improve after a few washings, but there's nothing, that can beat the comfort of 100% cotton, esp. around your face. Maybe this company will offer a 100% cotton version of this XL mask in the future for the ultimate reusable mask. Additionally, these masks lack a metal nose piece, and there are gaps present between the bridge of the nose and either cheek. I might harvest a nose piece before I throw away the next one and figure out a way to use it on these masks. Despite the cons, these masks deserve 4 stars.",US,2020-07-21
4,XL For Real,"I‚Äôve tried other ‚Äúxl‚Äù masks that were no such. This XL fits over my big sexy face & my big sexy beard. Thanks to the manufacturer - I don‚Äôt have to resort to veterinary options

Update - wore this for a brisk walk with the dog. NOT for athletic use. This mask is thick & well-made & it absorbs every drop of sweat it touches & holds it tightly around your mouth & nose. Had to call it after mile 1/2 (of customary 4). These are larger & fit better than most others, but I‚Äôll only be using these for sedentary pursuits. I‚Äôve found adidas masks are slightly smaller but MUCH more suited for use while moving.",US,2020-07-14
4,"Seems well made, in Vietnam","Seems well made. I attached a photo of the info sheet that came in the package with them. It states to Wash Before First Use and Made in Vietnam. Not that anything is wrong with being made in Vietnam, but someone else stated they were made in USA.",US,2020-06-28
4,Great mask; runs big,"First, I like most of the qualities of this mask.
It‚Äôs soft, and the material that goes behind the ears is also soft and stretchy. It‚Äôs breathable, so it doesn‚Äôt get overly hot when wearing it for extended periods. My kids also like it and will wear it, which is really important with school starting part-time again.

I knew the masks didn‚Äôt have nose-wires, and I plan on adding my own. But the major drawback is sizing. I ordered according to the size chart, and the masks are much too big. By measurements, the large should have fit me and my oldest, and the medium should have fit my youngest. Instead, the medium fits me and my oldest, and the small fits my youngest. So I basically ended up paying twice for the masks. Definitely size down when you buy these.",US,2020-08-11
4,Passed The Match & Light Test,"We washed these masks upon receiving them and they stayed in their normal shape, no shrinkage.
The masks are very soft and comfortable. The ear loops are as well. They are easy to breath in and fit both men and women alike, as My husband wore one and he really likes it . We put the mask to the light challenge and no light came through the mask, we then lite a match and with the mask on tried to blow out the flame and could not . We have tried this with other masks and some have failed miserable, but not this one. If they had other colors we would for sure purchase another set or two to have one for daily use. We were pleasantly surprised and are very happy with out purchase.",US,2020-08-06
4,Only missing one thing,"These masks have been great overall, and are much more comfortable and higher quality than others I own. However, I don't understand why any mask would come without some kind of nose bridge piece to keep it in place. I am constantly having to adjust it into position as, due to being male and having stubble on my face, it pulls down if I'm doing anything else but breathing through my nose. I have gone ahead and ordered my own nose pieces that I'll try to fasten myself, but these should be a must. Having a mask that you need to constantly touch to adjust partially defeats the health benefits of such a mask. If this mask were to have a nose bridge to better hold it in place, I could easily be convinced to give five starts considering price, material, and number of masks.",US,2020-07-21
4,Finally a mask that fits,"I've wasted way so much money on masks that don't fit. The masks would slip down my nose and when I pulled it up, it would slip up over my chin. Super annoying when you're trying not to touch your face. These masks cover my whole face without having to shift it around. I'm so happy the other reviews weren't fake. I gave it four stars so it wouldn't look like a scam but these really are five stars.",US,2020-07-05
4,Sizing Is Inconsistent!!,"In mid-July I purchased a package of the ""Large"" in Black. They fit and seal perfectly around nose and mouth. They are very breathable and comfortable, and stretch perfectly, and do not gap or leave any openings for air to seep in or out. They have three layers of material. They are my favorite mask...UNTIL I decided to buy another pack of Large Black later in July, and in August, and those Larges were much bigger! I would say the ""new"" Large is more like an Extra Large. I can only imagine how huge the Extra Large size must be! Recently I ordered the Medium, thinking that the ""Medium"" has replaced the older version ""Large."" I was wrong...those are too small, more suited for a small adult. teenager or child. I am disappointed that now I cannot buy another pair of the original Large that was available in early-mid July. I had to give the Large to my husband, and it even gaps a bit on his face! BRING BACK the SMALLER LARGE!",US,2020-08-27
4,Revived two different sizes in a bulk order,"I ordered 2 packs for my daughter to start school, both orders were for the same size. I had previously ordered a pack in white, and loved them so much that I wanted 2 of the black (well, because white is problematic for kids haha) but one of the black packs I ordered showed up in a larger size...way too big for my child staring kindergarten, but not big enough for myself or my spouse to utilize.",US,2020-07-19
4,Finally a 3 layered mask ‚Äî not just 2 layers,"It was really nice to finally find a 3 layered mask (that doesnt need those disposable filters) to protect my 4 year old. Almost all kids masks are just 2 layers of cotton which is zero protection.

The shape of the mask fit nicely on his face and stayed on his nose without constantly falling. Soft, light, and breathable.

I only gave it 4 stars because the ear loops were the length of my adult masks... could work well for older kids but not 4 years old.

Si had to cut off 3.5cm from each ear loop and sow it to attach again. If you know how to needle and thread a few stitches, then this is perfect!",US,2020-08-28
4,Fits well and good value,"Finally, a mask that fits! My third purchase of supposedly ""XL"" reusable face masks; none of the previous were even close to as big as the awful blue disposable ones.

These Enerplex are easy to breath through, soft and comfortable, and have enough structure that they don't deflate and itch, or mess up my mustache. The ear elastic is snug enough and doesn't pull or pinch. And I don't look or feel like I'm wearing a child's mask.

I didn't give them five stars because there's no formable nosepiece, thus the mask gaps under the eyes and also a little between the ear loops",US,2020-09-10
4,Great non-medical masks,"If you are looking for a larger sized non-medical mask that fits well. this is the mask fo you! I have a giant head and these are the most comfortable masks I have found nothing short of stellar for comfort and they seem to hold up well under washing. They are a bit pricey considering they what they are but, it is worth it! I Recommend this to anyone searching for a comfortable well-made facemask",US,2020-08-01
4,"Nice material, good shape, 5 starts on sewing!","Just arrived. The fit is a true medium. It is a little large on my 8 year old, and ever so slightly to small on me. We both have small faces. I can make it work, and a large probably would have been too big. The plus: nice fabric, immaculate sewing/quality, the fabric design keeps it from sucking in and out as I breath and talk. Yet there are NO gaps around my face - it fits snug, and I feel protected. I guess I never realized I was a heavy breather until the pandemic! Most cloth masks are impossible for me for this reason.

My only wishes: a bead on each elastic piece for tightening (I don't need it, but my daughter does. We knotted each ear instead). I think ALL masks should come with a metal nose wire for people with glasses. These do not have it, and I do not see an easy way to add one without destroying the mask's protection.

Other people may also want: a place for a filter. I don't use them, but for those that like to add it in, these do not have a filter sleeve.

The quality and fit still garner a 4+ star rating from me!",US,2021-01-30
4,BEST MASK!,"These masks are incedibly comfortable and fit perfect.!
I am very pleased.
Any mask you wear in very hot waether will be a little warm.
That said, the comfort and fit of this mask make it 100% my go to.
Ordering more!",US,2020-07-09
4,"Very Comfortable, Soft and Breathable!","The mask are very nice, they fit our faces well from the bridge of our noses all the way to under our chins. And we got some big skulls lol

Fogging of glasses is minimal & even with my thick beard it‚Äôs snug enough to give full coverage. For close to 100% protection, doctors recommend wearing a surgical mask under a cloth one & these are very comfortable with a surgical mask underneath it, even after hours of wear.

THEY DO PASS THE FLASHLIGHT TEST WITH ANOTHER SURGICAL MASK! That test is to shine a flashlight through the mask and if you can‚Äôt see the light, you have the best protection. If you can see a small bit of light, that‚Äôs okay too but if you‚Äôre able to add another layer without compromising your breathing, doctors suggest you do so.

The only reason I‚Äôm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered the 3 pack large mask, but only 2 were consistent in size. The 3rd mask was a tiny bit smaller, kinda like a medium large, not a large large. With some adjusting on the face, it fits just fine but it‚Äôs not exact like the other 2 large mask I got.

I wish I could give 4.5 stars instead of 4 because this is something minor & probably only occurs 1 out of 100,000 orders. I will still buy again though.

Stay safe, y‚Äôall!",US,2021-01-23
4,Questionable stitching but okay mask,"Came in a plastic sealable transparent bag. They are soft and comfortable to wear. Smooth as cotton and easy to breath in when you have a breeze outside and relatively cool inside. I notice it doesn't come with a nose guard that prevents any exhale air to escape to your face. And it does not properly stay put on your face for long periods at a time. You have to adjust the mask every once in a while. Also, it doesn't have any filter pocket inside of the mask. So if you like a mask with a pocket to put your carbon filter in, you might have to look elsewhere.

The only thing I have a problem with this mask is the stitches. Especially on the sides with the elastic earband. It doesn't feel very secure to me. I worry that it might fall apart after a few washes from the washer. ( I hope it does not come to that but we'll see.) Besides that, it's a comfortable little mask as a backup to my other masks I have on hand.",US,2021-01-18
4,Seems to be good,"I have a small face and wear glasses, this fits me fine and so far has not fogged my glasses. I Can breathe easily. I did the blow test and the flame did not waiver. I‚Äôm satisfied.",US,2020-08-29
4,Comfortable as a mask can be.,"The shape and size of these masks are so comfortable...great for a small face or for kids 5+
For better protection a filter would be good, but no place to insert one.",US,2020-08-05
4,"She likes the large, I like the XL","...but they are hot in AZ. That said, the different sizes are nice and 3 ply is beneficial plus they are very soft and machine wash. Wow but then that's made in America.",US,2020-07-13
4,Good quality and breathable but not medical grade,"Very good quality and easy to breathe. Great fit with no gaps with room over mouth for comfort.
You can see light through the mask which means the weave is not tight enough to keep viral particles out. Understand if you can breathe freely then those airborne particles will pass right through the multilayer fabric into your lungs.
I would wear this mask with a disposable mask depending on where you are being exposed like
a grocery store, restaurant, or indoors. Outside it would be fine. Social distancing and limited exposure indoors when using this mask. These are not medical grade and you will notice your face is getting warm. Needs to be 100% cotton no polyester which is at 65%!",US,2020-11-15
4,"Soft, comfy, but loose","I bought a small size (blue) for our really petit son. The fabric is super soft and snuggly--son's favorite so far. However, the earloop elastic was a bit too long so we had to tie them, which creates little discomfort on the ear. Additionally, the mask does not have a nose band, which allows air inflow. If you are going to use this in low-risk environment, I would recommend it (such as for a quick trip to the grocery store in the early hours), but not for school.",US,2020-07-18
4,Solid Masks,I bought the Cotton Cute Mouth Face Mouth Cover and the EnerPlex 3-Ply which were both well represented on Amazon when purchased. I would say the Cotton Cute Mouth Face Mouth Cover are pretty thick and more difficult to breathe through than I prefer. I did feel safe when wearing them out in public since they really do cover up your face to the point that the front tip of the mask actually sucked in and out while breathing. The EnerPlex 3-Ply was thinner and more comfortable to wear. Breathability was fairly effortless. My elderly mother preferred the EnerPlex as well. I plan to re-purchase the EnerPlex 3-Ply next time I need more quality masks.,US,2020-12-17
4,Really an XL!,"This face mask really is an extra large size. My husband is a big guy, 6‚Äô4‚Äù, and it has been impossible to find a mask that wasn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all that actually fit him without his ears looking like he was ready to take off and fly. This mask came in several sizes, and while it was hard to gauge how big an XL might really be, I took a chance and ordered it. Glad I did. If there was a rating for size, I would have given it 5 stars.",US,2020-07-27
4,Decent enough,"These masks fit, but tug on the ears and make them stick out a little. Granted I have a huge head, size 8 hat, so they will be fine for normal heads. The outside of the mask is cotton, the inside is polyester or something similar to nice basketball shorts. Very thick, which is probably good for protection but do restrict breathing a bit, and they are pretty hot.

That all said, they are stylish, and very high quality.",US,2020-07-06
4,Would be perfect if it had a nose wire - but it‚Äôs easy to add one!,"Size is great, but wish it had a nose wire to actually seal the face a bit. I fiddled around however, and it‚Äôs super easy to modify these to make one! Just unfold a thin paper clip or twist tie, and thread it into the seam. Works great now! I‚Äôd recommend a twist tie, since a paper clip is a little too stiff to squeeze into shape over your nose comfortably.",US,2020-11-18
4,"My favorite mask, but not perfect","This is a 5 star masks if I am rating based on comparison with every other mask I've worn. It's a 4 star mask compared with the ideal.

What I like
- Comes in sizes, and the XL is perfect for my large, bearded face
- Plenty of give on the hear pieces, nice and comfortable
- Material is so, so soft
- Simple construction, plain black color makes it blend in with my outfit

What could be better
- An adjustable nose bridge would be nice to ensure snug fit for the purpose of health and safety",US,2021-01-13
4,They came quick,I think these masks seem very comfortable very lightweight .....I thought they were going to be a little thicker.... I don't know if there's any inner layering for protection.... but I ordered a medium and the small youth size kind of scared me if it was too tight .. my face is not big.. it's not small... I thought the medium would be good..... but definitely a little too loose ....I have to adjust the ear Loops... have to tighten them. other than that when I tighten the loops I'm sure it'll be fine.... it seems very very comfortable... very very lightweight ....I would imagine it's good for protection ... shopping setting or just being in front of people social distancing... just got them.... I'm washing them and I'm going to adjust loops and try them out!!!,US,2020-07-27
4,Good,"I have bought 8 sets of these masks.. the different sizes are great since we couldn‚Äôt find large enough masks for the husband or smaller-fitting masks for our teen girls. The husband‚Äôs masks wear out fast since the fabric rubs on facial stubble and gets pilly. Also, they don‚Äôt come with strap adjusters like other masks at this price. I bought some adjusters on Amazon. I personally don‚Äôt find these, or any cloth masks, easy to breathe in so I stick to disposable masks. Overall, they work for most of the family.",US,2021-02-01
4,Shrinkage can be an issue.,These are smaller and fit my face as a petite woman so much better. Be aware they do shrink. I find mine have gotten tight behind my ears and get uncomfortable if I wear them more than an hour.,US,2020-08-17
4,Comfortable but the air filters easily.,"I bought these mask for my mom and my sister. I asked my sister, how protected she felt with mask. She told me ""they were very good"". My mom says otherwise. Actually she felt that it was safer to use a vandana than these facemask. I trust more my mom's opinion since she works in healthcare..
If you will use them for an extra layer of protection, go for it.",US,2020-07-14
4,Pretty good not the best with eyeglasses,"This is one of the better face masks that I have bought. However, there is no metal nosepiece so if you wear glasses be prepared to use the tissue trick (place a folded tissue across the bridge of your nose and under your eyes- it works) or be prepared for foggy lenses. The material is soft. Seems to offer good protection which is of more concern than breathability. The ear straps are plain elastic which can get uncomfortable with extended wear. Would I buy again? Yes, already have.",US,2020-12-02
4,Good for quick errands,"Good fit. Comfy. EZ breathe. Not a medical grade product so you will not have that seal. This is good for quick outings (shopping, errands, etc.). Not for full day excursions to places with lots of people. Not for anyone who wears glasses. You will fog.

It‚Äôs nice if you need something you can throw on in a hurry to run errands in low to semi-moderately populated places.",US,2020-06-29
4,Wrong size,"Ordered a medium but received a small. Unfortunately I washed them before trying them on. Was so happy to have finally bought a washable mask instead of using the disposable ones that I washed them before checking to be sure I got the right size that I ordered. Can‚Äôt return them now. Not able to review their comfort level since they don‚Äôt fit well, but they do seem soft and that they might be comfortable in the right size. My advice is check the size when you receive them before washing. Seems rather obvious now.",US,2020-11-03
4,Comfortable and durable,"I'm back to make my second purchase of these masks. I bought my first about 2 months ago and have been satisfied. I use these masks mostly when I am out and about in my neighborhood and walking or exercising. They are not as thick, so they are comfortable and breathable to me when doing low or moderate-intensity activities. I also put these in the washer (and dryer) after each use, and they are holding up well. If I go to a more higher-risk environment where I may have to be in closer proximity with people, I use my other masks with triple layer protection and room for a filter - but these are fine for low-risk/contact activities.",US,2020-08-10
4,More comfortable than most masks,"I find these masks to be more comfortable than other masks I've tried. Since they're structured, I feel like I actually have some room to breathe and talk inside of the mask. I just wish they had a metal thingy on the nose area to be able to tighten it there a bit to avoid fogging my glasses. But, even without that nose piece, I find my glasses fog less with these masks compared to others without a nose piece. I'm a petite woman and the medium fits me well.",US,2020-09-27
4,Better than most,I measured exactly as the product specified and ones that came were too large,US,2020-08-03
4,Great except for ear hooks,"I like the fact that the material is soft and breathable. It fits nicely. I'm a big guy and the large fits just fine. The only thing I don't like is that the ear hook pieces are very rough on the ears and starts hurting after extended wear. I'm an Uber driver and have to wear a mask for long hours. If that part was softer material, these would be perfect. I'd still recommend these as long as you don't have to wear these for several hours at a time.",US,2020-11-09
4,"Great Fit, quality product","Very happy with the quality and fit(i got larges). I strongly suggest following the instructions and washing them first. Not sure what was on them but they were almost waterproof prior to washing, might have just been a combination of tight threads and machine dust. Regardless wash them and they become much more breathable/comfortable. I sun dried mine, so can't speak to if they will shrink in a dryer. I found the fit perfect out of the box, so didn't want to risk it.",US,2020-08-28
4,"Well made, but my face is borderline and didn't fit either size","Well made, arrived quickly, soft material, elastic ear straps make fitting easy. My face is 4.5"", between a youth and a large. Unfortunately neither size fit. Large fell off my face, youth just barely fit, and if I moved my mouth much to talk, it fell off my nose, and it's constantly moving up and down my nose, which I find annoying. My husband has a large and loves it - says it's much better for exercising in than his disposable mask and cotton mask. However, when I stretch the material as it would fit on my face, I can see light through it.",US,2020-08-02
4,Finally!!!!,I have purchased several different types of masks and none fit as well as this product. Most don't have size options so I was anxious to see how they fit. I followed the instructions as posted and purchased the large size and the fit is a great fit. Not big and loose where there are gaps between mask and face and large enough to cover my mouth and nose. Very good fit overall and easy to breathe with 3 ply. Will buy more for other family members. Highly recommend. The only suggestion I have is if they there was a pocket sewn on the inside to hold a filter that would be absolutely perfect.,US,2020-07-12
4,Warning - WASH BEFORE USE,"These are great and very affordable masks. Soft, comfortable and great breathability. HOWEVER, please don't make the mistake I made. The packaging says ""wash before wearing"" and I didn't do that. I put one on and went for a walk and out of nowhere, my throat COMPLETELY CLOSED and my whole body heated up. I couldn't breathe and started panicking. I took the mask off and threw it on the ground and slowly, my throat started to open up again. I was coughing and gagging and trying to breathe so a woman nearby called 911 and luckily, the attack subsided and everything was okay.

I've never known myself to be allergic to anything but I think there must be some type of chemical they use in manufacturing that I'm sensitive to. I don't know how likely it is that this could ever happen to you, and overall these are great masks, but just really wanted to put that warning out there for anyone who buys. Please wash before wearing - I think it makes a huge difference.",US,2021-02-05
4,Not bad,"This facemask fits well and is comfortable. It can be slightly difficult to breathe through at times and the fabric on the inside will tickle your nose every now and then.

That said, for winter time this mask is good for keeping your face warm",US,2020-12-13
4,Youth size is good for adult with small face,"I ordered a youth size and it‚Äôs a little loose. But I tied tiny little knots on the ear loops and it fits perfectly. I have an extremely small and narrow face with a protruding nose and I am a 30 year old petite adult woman. I had a lot of trouble finding a good fit and these are great with the knots tied. It is breathable and doesn‚Äôt slip down, unless of course, i do a big yawn. üëçüëç",US,2021-01-16
4,Good experience,"The delivery and price were fine. They give you good directions how to measure for size. We got the large which seem fine on my husband (who is the one who really needs them), but seem alittle bigger on me, like at the top. Will see, but very comfortable and soft on your skin.",US,2020-07-29
4,Fits big faces like mine. Can be warm.,"Other masks I've used are too small. Pulling them over the chin exposes the nose, and vice versa. Not this one. It's plenty big, soft, not itchy, and just snug enough. It gets a little clammy in warm weather. The best overall mask I've found so far.",US,2020-08-30
4,excellent second mask,I will not use this mask for stand alone protection. If you stretch it slightly it is easy to see light coming through. However as a second mask to cover those ubiquitous blue surgical masks it is excellent. It helps to close those side gaps that are so common and holds the blue mask firmly in place while adding at least some additional layer of filtration without concomitant smothering. The two together are now my go to rig.,US,2020-10-20
4,"Nice, small, for young kids. Didn't work for my older kids.","I read reviews and thought these might work for my tween daughters who are in that in between size. Some adult reviewers were wearing them. But they fit just like they are labeled, for 5-9 year old (small 9 year old). My daughters are 10 and petite 13, too small for them. Fabric is nice and soft and they look like they would fit comfortably if the sizing is right.",US,2021-01-14
4,My new favorite masks!,"Super comfortable and breathable. Feels like a tee shirt for my face üòä I love the fit and the way it curves under the eyes. (It's maybe the tiniest bit large? But not a problem, just doesn't fit too snug to my face like some others do.) The only complaint I have is that the ear straps seem less sturdy than others I've tried, but otherwise, I'm extremely pleased and will definitely buy these again.",US,2020-12-01
4,Comfortable and easy to breathe!,"We've ordered many varieties of masks over the last few months due to Covid-19, and of all of them, these are definitely the most comfortable to wear and the easiest to breathe through. As far as critiques go...I do wish they had a nose wire, as they do not create a very good seal on the top of the mask. And be warned that they are quite large, so my wife for example, has no hope of wearing this brand.",US,2020-09-21
4,"Lightweight, comfortable, and water resistant but the elastic strap length on each is inconsistent.","Lightweight mask with good materials, the outside polyester is somewhat water resistant while the inside cotton is nice and soft. It is comfortable to breathe in without getting too stuffy. However I am taking one star off for the varying fit. I ordered the large 3 pack and all 3 have different lengths for the elastic straps. The 1st one fits perfectly while the 2nd fits fairly well but the 3rd is just too loose.",US,2020-10-12
4,"at last, a cloth face mask that fits comfortably...","Thank you for this well made, comfortable cloth face mask (1 set of 3), that finally fits my small face and does not steam up my eyeglasses. The price seems high, but worth the comfort and fit.
Most of the other masks, from other sellers, that I have tried are not comfortable, too big, and steam up my prescribed eyeglasses. So I appreciate this seller on amazon.com.",US,2020-10-20
4,"""VERY FIRST BREATHABLE MASK""","The EnerPlex Premium 3-Ply Reusable Face Mask, came as promised in a sealed plastic bag. Had instructions on it's care in the bag. The mask itself, was very comfortable and had a 92% level of breathability to it. Online, you have a choice of 3 colors to choose from. This product, washed well and kept it's original shape. I am highly satisfied with this product and recommend it to all.",US,2020-10-12
4,Comfortable to wear,"Probably not much protection due to looser fit and no pocket for insertable filter, but this is a mask my family and I will wear because it is comfortable and the XL size fits our slightly larger faces. Lightweight fabric is very stretchy, as are the ear loops. It would be much better if ear loops were adjustable. Also, there is no wire above the nose to make it fit tighter under glasses, but I bought some separate wire strips that can be stuck on. A mask only works is you can stand to wear it, and these provide at least some protection for folks who can't tolerate tighter and thicker masks. We have others to wear when we need better protection.",US,2020-07-24
4,Fogs up Glasses,"Firstly, if you wear glasses, get something else. Unless you want to perform some geometric tucking and folding, your glasses will definitely fog up.

If you don‚Äôt wear glasses, this is really good! Sleek design, soft but keeps its shape, strings don‚Äôt hurt your ears, medium can fit probably anyone 100lbs-200lbs. Does a good job of protecting you.",US,2020-10-08
4,Excellent!,"I initially bought a size medium and they were a bit too small. The large fits great - follow the recommended measuring guide for the best fit. The wire nose bridge - which these don't have - is not needed because of the great fit. I've bought three orders so far. My only complaint is the front seem is off-center, but not too bad.",US,2020-12-18
4,Good purchase,These mask are very comfortable and soft. They passed the candle/lighter test. They are breathable but I prefer them for outside events because they feel less breathable indoors to me so I do not recommend for long term wear (INDOORS only). Prefect for the fall/winter months I would need to see about wearing it during warmer months. The mask did reduce the fogging of my glasses compare to other mask but not completely.,US,2021-01-21
4,Good face mask for older kids,"I got this product for my younger kids (5 and 8) but as it said for kids 3-9, but it actually fit my 11 and 14 year old daughters instead. Was just too big and loose for my 8 year old with no easy way to adjust it. That said, my 14 year old daughter likes the mask much more than the ‚Äúsmall adult‚Äù one that we got for her.... fits her great.",US,2020-07-12
4,Small,"The medium I ordered even after measuring were in my opinion small. Think Next size up(large) may fit better.
Overall seem well made and comfortable. Just to small. I‚Äôll give these to my grand daughters may fit them.",US,2020-08-01
4,XL face mask,"My face from my nose to my ear is 5,5/8 inches so it is pretty big and the XL just fit it, so if you got bigger face it would be difficult to fit you, if kind of hard to breath at the begging and ear loops feels a light tight after using it a couple hours but with the use it looses a little bit, I used them for work in a restaurante for at least 10 hours a day so you get use to them. I will recommend them, I will go get them again when I start working more days, and it is hard to find a mask who fits big faces. It took me a while to find this ones. There are the measures so you can be sure about it. XL size face mask.",US,2020-09-29
4,Great customer service,"It didn't fit well, even worse if you have to talk... my chin pulls it down below my nose.
Giving it 4 stars because their customer service is outstanding. They emailed me shortly after I received delivery to ask how I liked their product. I replied and told them of my issue, they responded immediately and offered to replace it although a different size at no cost to me. I am waiting for the replacement to give it another try",US,2020-12-24
4,Finally Big enough,"First, I hate wearing face mask since I have breathing difficulties. All others have been way to small for my head and beard, hard to breath , etc. But as a must do, these are the best I have found.",US,2020-07-29
4,I can breathe,"As soon as I received this mask, I tried it on and was immediately happy! This is the first cloth mask I've tried where breathing was completely unrestricted. Unfortunately, after a few hours of wearing, I began to get that pain behind my ears where the bands sit. Super bummed about that. I may try a larger size to see if that helps.
I also like how the inside of the mask is black as well. I wear tinted chapstick. On other masks I own, the insides become stained with lip color. I do completely realize the transfer of colors and oils happen whether I can see it or not, and I do wash them after each use, but it's nice putting on a clean mask without visually seeing stains from previous uses.",US,2020-11-17
4,They don't have the best fit,"They're very soft and comfortable, and hold up well after washing them. However, I ordered the recommended size for an adult female and they are too large. I have to pull them up and adjust them pretty frequently because they are just a little too big.

Furthermore, I bought these to use in the gym, and for regular gym use (strength training, machines, etc) they are great but for cardio when I breathe deeply they get sucked in to my face which takes some getting used to.",US,2021-01-04
4,Great until price increase,"This is the perfect size for my face. I'm a nurse & hate wearing a mask all the time, always feeling like i can't breathe. Very soft, moderately breathable & very comfortable. First mask I've found that I don't have to constantly tug on to pull it down over my double chin. Gets a little sticky inside if you are a mouth breather, which I am.

Too bad the price went up $6.00. I was just about to order some of the black ones. Guess I'll be shopping around some......",US,2021-02-05
4,"Very comfortable, even for my fat face.","I was skeptical at first, but decided to try these XL masks anyway. I am very happy with them. They are very soft, I breath easier and if I had to make one suggestion, it would be that they add a metal nose bridge so you could tighten it around your nose better. Otherwise, these fit my fat face perfectly. :)",US,2020-11-13
4,You get what they describe.,Not much to say other than they are a good mask. Love how soft they are that‚Äôs my favorite thing about them. Haven‚Äôt washed them yet so I will be curious to see how they hold up. Upon purchase I just threw them in a hot dryer to eliminate any germs in the process of them being made and receiving them. So far I would definitely recommend this if you want a simple good mask.,US,2020-12-05
4,Good and comfortable,"I have a large head and they fit great. They're soft and comfortable. My only issue is that they are not as cool on the face as I'd like, but I hate masks altogether and I haven't found one that doesn't feel hot to some degree. However, these are definitely cooler, more breathable, and more comfortable than your typical mask.",US,2020-11-14
4,Almost perfect. Very good buy.,"Almost perfect but not quite. The size was perfect fit and felt comfortable and breathable! BUT... after wearing it for a long while i noticed that the ear strings began to make my ears hurt from being pulled. Now i know 90% of face masks have this issue but the one i had before these had a ""shoelace like"" material that was less elastic hence more gentle on ear tugging. A few times my mouth was able to grab the fabric while i would be talking but maybe its because i have a fatter face and above average head size. All in all, i still would highly recommend this mask as it is my second favorite so far.",US,2020-11-25
4,Very hot to wear,It‚Äôs a good quality mask. The biggest drawback is the heat. This mask does not breathe. I understand that a mask is safer if it contains your breath as much as possible without suffocating you ‚Äî which this mask does well. But my goodness does it get hot! I‚Äôll be using this as my ‚Äúwinter‚Äù mask. It‚Äôs no good in 90¬∞F heat.,US,2020-09-08
4,Very comfortable on the ears,"These masks were larger than the ones I had been wearing. These masks comfortably cover my face from nose to chin. More importantly, they are very breathable and are very comfortable on the ears. There are no ear adjustments, but I have not need them. I would buy more of these when I wear these out.",US,2020-12-08
4,Good Mask,"This is a good mask. I got this size for my hubby who is a big man, fits well & is much better than the typical hospital type. I Would recommend it. It still can cause your glasses to fog up.",US,2020-06-09
4,comfortable,"As far as masks go that offer good protection, this one is comfortable & breathable. Depending on weather and activity, yes it can get warm inside, but any good mask would. I have a small face and the Large fits me great. I deducted 1 star because I feel $7 for each mask is a bit high.",US,2021-01-25
4,Mask ear loops,I bought these the first time they fit great no issues at all. I bought a second set and they were very big around the ears. I tied a knot at the end. I feel that they are good quality that they are comfortable and the only complaints like I stated was the air loops on the 2nd order were too big.,US,2020-11-25
4,Great for guys with beards but not perfect,Great for men with beards. I purchase this for my hubby and he loves it. The blue standard masks would rise up with his beard or would snap off my the ears. This is a great alternative: The only negative thing I have to say is that it flaps in / moves as you inhale and exhale and when you hand wash it the dye bleeds a lot.,US,2020-07-24
4,Too big for me,"I wasn't sure which size to get and while reading the reviews, lots of people recommended the large for adults. My mistake, they were too large and barely stayed on my face. I constantly had to pull it up and kept fogging up my glasses when I breathed. I'll have to try the Medium because they are comfortable.",US,2020-09-04
4,Comfortable but large,"Purchased these masks for my child‚Äôs Communion for my husband and I. Very lightweight and comfortable material. I gave it four stars because they were large on me. They fit my husband well. Women with smaller faces may have a hard time trying to keep these on. Overall, very nice feel though.",US,2020-09-25
4,Elastic stretches,"I ordered the medium size for my 9-year-old after measuring as directed. When these arrived, they fit perfectly. But after a couple weeks of wearing and washing (in cold water, drip dry), the elastic had stretched a lot. I had to get out a needle and thread and sew the elastic loops to be tighter so that the mask would stay up for him. But with that said, I would probably order more because it's so hard to find masks that fit children well. Giving it four stars based on comparison with other masks.",US,2020-11-25
4,Good mask at reasonable price,"I‚Äôve bought many different brands of mask to try and find ones that can keep up with me or don‚Äôt suffocate me while working out. These mask are easy to breathe through and comfortable but since I sweat so much, I do have to change out my mask frequently. It helps that there are three in this pack at a reasonable price. Although they can‚Äôt keep up with my sweating, but really haven‚Äôt found any that can, I‚Äôve bought another set as backup. I usually end up using one under armour mask and two of these mask in my one hour workout. I‚Äôve tried other types and so far these are the second best to my under armour but are better priced.",US,2020-12-11
4,It fits my tiny face!,"I bought the size medium and they fit wonderfully but I do have a small face. The large fit my husband well.

They don‚Äôt pass the candle test but they aren‚Äôt as bad as some others I‚Äôve seen. They wash well and the elastic seems sturdy. I was worried it was the elastic that will fall apart but so far so good.
Great value and I‚Äôm so happy with the size!",US,2020-08-28
4,Cloth face masks,"These are soft and comfortable, and the large size fits my oversized head very well.
Would have given 5 stars if they were equipped with a flexible insert to wrap over my nose and keep my glasses from fogging up, although that was not something in the description, so they are just as advertised.",US,2020-09-29
4,Perfect mask when you add a nose bridge strip.,"Over all, this mask is the most comfortable and breathable mask that I've tried. I wear a 7 5/8 hat - my head is on the large end of the spectrum. This mask fit very well. The only complaint that I have is the lack of a metal nose strip. To correct this I inserted a small piece of wire in the fabric above the nose and it made for a great seal. With that modification this mask is perfect for me. Fortunately, there are several amazon sources for metal strips with an adhesive backing that make the addition of a nose strip effortless. I trust this mask.",US,2020-12-08
4,Great masks but delicate,I bought these not long ago. I love the feel and look of them. I got a pack of 3 large; it fits my face well. I only put 4 stars because one of the masks broke around the ear loop after about a week of using them. Luckily I still have 2 more but I would have liked to see better quality on these.,US,2020-10-25
4,"Comfortable, but not snug.","They are more comfortable then most! I work in a hospital and must wear the blue paper masks at work, so these are softer. The only negative thing is that there is no wire insert around the nose, so it‚Äôs not a tight fit. For a short run, it‚Äôs not bad, but not sure how much unfiltered air comes in through the top.",US,2020-10-26
4,Nice feel and weight,"I tried to go by measurements given in the description. I'm a pretty small woman and have a smaller face but the measurements made me think I needed a large. They are a bit loose on me but I will wash them and if they shrink any at all they will probably fit just fine. That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. I like it that they are a 3-layer mask. A few more color choices would be nice, but that's just me. They are a good mask.",US,2020-08-13
4,"Super comfortable, not super breathable","I like these a lot, probably the most comfortable mask I own. Fabric and straps are excellent. Only complaint is the material is not the most breathable I've tried - that would be the Uniqlo Airisms, but those run small. Still looking for the perfect mask, but these are pretty close.",US,2020-09-08
4,Feels like a wool sweater in Florida,"I wanted to like these. They fit my small face perfectly. And at first, I thought ""these are pretty soft and breathable"" BUT I live in Florida. And it has been cooler (it's not summer hot right now) however these masks are warm. They start out ok but then within about 30 minutes at work I am sweaty and out feels like a wool sweater on my face. UGH I endured them for a 40 hour work week. Then I gave up and bought a different kind. These were not for this Florida girl.",US,2020-12-23
4,Inconsistent sizing,"I ordered the same product twice, once early in the COVID pandemic and again just recently. Both orders were for the large face masks. The first order fits great! The second order is not the best. The masks are clearly larger. Not sure if the wrong ones were shipped or if the sizing has changed. The masks are great. Just wish the sizing was consistent.",US,2021-01-13
4,Comfortable but a bit warm for summer,"The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I found the mask to be very warm on a warm day. I'm sure this won't matter so much as winter arrives, but for hot California summer days, I found I sweated in it, even while doing nothing more than walking around outside. Otherwise it is very comfortable.",US,2020-10-05
4,Super comfortable,"Since Covid, I been buying many cloth face masks and so far these are the most comfortable ones I own. The mask is thick enough yet stretchy and breathable. The ear bands are comfortable and dont pull on my ears. The only downside is that I wish it had the nose wire than the mask would be perfect.",US,2020-08-03
4,"Great XL fit, just a bit warm","The XL fits very comfortably on my husband's head. He has a large head and a beard.
The mask stays over his nose unless he is talking very animatedly, and it doesn't pull his ears forward like regular size masks do.
The fabric is thick and he said it is a bit warm when inside.",US,2021-01-13
4,Good face mask,"I like these face masks because they are soft, washable, re-usable, and well made. However, they fit a little loose around the nose and cheeks. I did measure my face before I ordered it in size large but after the first use it was a little loose. I‚Äôm going to order some in Medium and hopefully it‚Äôs a better fit.",US,2020-07-24
4,"Great, but no wire bendy thingy for your nose","In general, I like these. They are comfortable to wear, not too hot, and they don't fall apart in the wash. I got the XL, and I wish it was even a little bigger, but I can get by with this. The problem it that there is no little bendy thingy to make it fit tight to your nose, so I get a lot of air out of there and fog up my glasses. I can cram my glasses down on top of the mask and make it work, but long-term, I think I will take one of the metal pieces out of a disposable mask and try to sew it in here. Note: my nose is probably different from your nose, so you may get a different result.",US,2020-10-15
4,Great for small faces and claustrophobic people,I have a very small face for an adult and am claustrophobic. I love having this choice of colors and if I have to wear a mask I choose this one. Came very fast. Is washable and hang dry. Soft and great for those who can't stand things on their face.,US,2020-11-02
4,Order small if you have a small face,"I know it says to order medium for older kids or adults with small faces, but I wish I would have ordered a small because it still slides below my nose. But this is still a good product and I feel like I can breathe with it on and it doesn't look large and bulky.",US,2020-09-19
4,Comfortable,"I got a large size, which was pretty roomy--I probably could have gotten the medium. But they are very comfortable and pretty soft, although not as soft as another brand I bought. But these seem sturdier and more likely to provide protection than the really soft kind.",US,2020-09-10
4,Comfy but of dubious durability,"I ordered a 3 pack of these recently and washed them as directed upon arrival, then went to try one on and one of the straps immediately ripped off of the mask upon stretching it to put on my face. I do not have a very large head and did not pull hard at all to try to put it on. The others fit fine and are very comfortable though, so it may have just been a defective one.

Edit: I have been contacted by EnerPlex and they are sending me a new pack. We'll see if I just received a defective mask or not. No issues with the other two so far.

Edit 2: All of the masks from the replacement pack are holding up fine.",US,2020-11-01
4,Works great,Really like how the product feels. I had to deal with a super thick mask for eight weeks during training which made it hard to breathe; this one manages to make me feel protected without inhibiting my breathing. I got the medium one and it fits perfect.,US,2020-08-24
4,Pulls on my ears more than some other masks.,I bought this at the recommended size and although the mask is soft and breathable it fits too tightly on my ears. I wore them a few times and then accidentally put them in the dryer and they shrunk just a little bit making the masks too small for me to wear.,US,2020-09-05
4,Great Mask with One Missing Thing,The mask is large as described. Soft. Easy to breathe. 3-Ply. Fits good. Just one thing: it doesn't have a nose wire which means it gaps open around the nose letting air escape in and out which also fogs up your glasses.,US,2020-12-17
4,Try this one!,I have COPD and had extreme difficulty breathing through every mask I have used. I am pleased to say that this mask has helped me tremendously. Comfortable and soft with breathable fabric. I highly recommend.,US,2020-12-30
4,Sizes are larger than noted.,I bought these mask for my children. I measured and ordered according to the size chart. The mask arrived and are too big. I had to adjust the straps around the ears to make them smaller and fit snug on their faces. The mask themselves are also a bit large. I would recommend to buy the smaller size recommended and not the size the chart recommends. Other than that I like the mask. They seem to be well made and comfortable otherwise.,US,2020-08-07
4,I can tell it works,"Let me put it like this: One day at work I had to sit for an hour about 25 ft from where they were emptying the septic tank and I couldn't smell a thing. Also couldn't blow out a candle with it on. Not bad for a cheap cloth mask. Would have given 5 stars if it wasnt so loose around the nose, but honestly I have had to readjust every mask I've owned so far after speaking a sentence or two.",US,2020-08-31
4,"Sizing is off, great customer service!","Edit: The company reached out to me and re-sent me another set of masks that fit much better. The sizing must have been off on the one set. I now have 5 sets of these masks, and they are holding up and working out well (for both me and my kids). The company was extremely responsive and great to deal with.

I've ordered 4 sets of these masks, 2 sets of mediums (for my kids) and 2 sets of large (for myself). Sizing is inconsistent. The last set of mediums (for my boys) won't even stay on their faces - they are so much bigger than the previous set.",US,2020-07-22
4,soft but a little big with no way to adjust,"These are soft, and I think I would really like the fit if they had some way of tightening up the ear loops. I like the mask itself, just a little loose on the ear loops. I got the size suggested based off of the measurements given.",US,2020-12-09
4,Great fit but very hot.,"These fit me better than most other masks, however they‚Äôre extremely hot. Great for fit, but I still tend to reach for other, more breathable masks that I have. I‚Äôm 150 lb woman, for reference.... I‚Äôm not typically overheated in other masks. Thank you for the nice fit! I may appreciate this more in cooler weather.",US,2020-08-15
4,Very soft and comfortable. No problem breathing,These masks are very comfortable. I took away one star for comfort only because these masks tend to slide off my nose while wearing them. They don't stay put. I fixed that by putting a little liquid latex inside the nose tip to hold it in place. Other than that they are great!,US,2020-08-18
4,These Masks Do The Job,"Although I much prefer my plastic face shield, these masks are well made and comfortable. The way they are shaped, I actually end up using them upside down, and they fit my face better. Go figure.... They are a bit warm on a hot summer day. Otherwise, I am pleased with the purchase.",US,2020-08-21
4,Good coverage,"Fit is large, I would size down. I measured my face and my husbands from nose to chin as it directed and went with the size indicated (L for me, XL for him). They were slightly large and I think we could have sized down. I definitely could not wear the XL - it covered my whole face! However, these are comfortable, soft fabric, and have very good coverage. No noses peeking out!",US,2020-10-17
4,Good mask but lack of nose wire fogs glasses,"These are quite comfortable. However, I wear reading glasses and the lack of a nose wire leaves a gap below the glasses, which causes the glasses to fog up. If you don't wear glasses, I highly recommend them. If you do wear glasses, it can be a problem.",US,2020-08-06
4,Almost a great mask,This is comfortable and it fits well for young and old age. I only gave it a four stars because I wish it has the option of inserting a filter like my other masks. If you don‚Äôt care for using a filter then it‚Äôs one of the best mask out there.,US,2020-10-06
4,Wearing at the Gym,"Did A LOT of research on the most breathable masks and this was one of the top rated. After wearing at the gym found it's great for HIIT classes, terrible for spin classes.",US,2020-10-02
4,"Soft, no run away fibers going up nose!","Soft fabric and so far no fabric little fibers going up my nose! A total plus! But for me a little thick to wear all day at work. And then though, if I roll it down a little while at my desk ( no one around for 10 feet) it‚Äôs good because it‚Äôs soft and no fibers!",US,2020-09-19
4,Great,I originally bought masks of this type for my husband and he found they were to small for him. Got these in XL and solved that problem. They fit him much better than the standard or large ones but are the same material and style.,US,2020-08-28
4,Legit XL mask.,"I have a giant head. I‚Äôm a size 8 fitted baseball cap, the mask search has been annoying. This has been the best planks purchase so far. I‚Äôve spent more money for lesser quality than these. If you‚Äôre looking for a legit XL mask this is a good purchase.",US,2020-07-08
4,No Nose Bridge,"Pretty good in the comfort area, but there is nothing to close off the nose area for glasses users. I ended up shoving a paper clip in so I could form the nose area around my nose to stop moisture from fogging up my glasses.",US,2020-09-21
4,Very comfortable with extender strap,"We like the fabric and so far the washes have been great and hasn't faded or changed it's comfort. We wear the ""Mask Extender Strap Hook,Anti-Slip Mask Buckle Strap Adjustable"" with these since we're glasses wearers.",US,2020-10-20
4,Good mask as long as ear bands are not twisted.,"This is a pretty good mask. It fits well, stays together when you wash it, breathes good. One of the negatives it that the ear bands on a couple were twisted and as such they won‚Äôt sit flat on your ears. You can‚Äôt fix this either.",US,2020-08-24
4,Perfect for larger head and face people,My husband has a large head and face . Most masks fit too tight and his glasses fog up . Thus mask is soft comfortable and allows him to wear it low enough without exposing his nose to prevent glasses fogging up .,US,2020-10-22
4,Good Mask,"The mask is of good quality but somewhat thin. The main problem was the size. The medium size was big for me. The customer service was excellent. They sent us a smaller size, which unfortunately was small. So even though I have these masks I only wore it once over a period of one month because it does not fit me properly.",US,2020-10-17
4,Very Comfortable!,"Very Comfortable! Only problem for me is I wear glasses and they steam up, I thought with the shape of mask dipping below glasses they would work. I actually have an extra nose pincher that I‚Äôm using, so working now for me",US,2020-12-06
4,Very comfortable/breathable but beware of sizing!,"Okay so these are great masks with nice stretchiness to them! That being said I knocked a star off my review because I ordered a medium and when the masks arrived I was shocked by how small a medium was. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù slimmer build and smaller face (so I thought..) but when I tried all three on, they were so small that in order to cover my mouth fully, my nose was fully exposed. I reordered a larger size so hopefully those will fit better! But weird sizing aside, they are made from a very comfortable material and I‚Äôm excited for the larger size to arrive and hopefully fit much better.",US,2020-09-20
4,Comfy,I got these for my husband as he works maintenance in a high humidity environment and most masks are one size fits all. These are WAY more comfortable on the ears (I got him an XL) and tuck up under the glasses so the fogging is minimized.,US,2020-07-09
4,There isn't a nose piece,"While the product is what was advertised I failed to notice that the masks don't have a nose piece to provide not only a better fit, but also to provide better coverage. I took nose pieces from paper masks, cut the clothe on the purchased masks, and retrofitted them - disappointing to have to change a brand new mask.",US,2020-08-18
4,Okay mask but arrived damaged,Perfect mask that is breathable. My only concern was that it broke before I even step foot outside with it. Gonna try to sew it but wish the stitching was better. The two white grips are mine from an old mask because I have a small face.,US,2020-09-02
4,Good quality üëçüèºüëçüèº,Perfect size for my 10 years old !! Fits for 6 years old too. üëçüèº,US,2020-09-17
4,Great Fit!! Great Buy!,"Wow!!! Very impressed with the quality of these masks!!üëçüëçüëç

The face masks/face coverings I‚Äôve used were all too big and cumbersome and I found myself touching my face a lot more than I needed.üò£

The size chart was very helpful in getting that good fit!!
I actually look forward to wearing them.

I have yet to wear for extended time.....extended for me would be 3-4hrs... That‚Äôs where I will really put these to the test.

Will come back and share those results

As of now... I would HIGHLY recommend these face coverings!!!!!",US,2020-08-25
4,Great. But plz add nose wire.,These are great. I have a large face and are the only ones that I found the fit well. One reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars because I feel like it should also have the little metal wire to tighten the fit around the nose especially for people who wear glasses but more modified it myself.,US,2020-10-03
4,"Heavy Duty, Soft but not very breatheable","These masks arrived well packaged and the material is very soft. I ordered the largest size and I still struggled to use them as intended. When I breathe in and out, the mask folds in and out making it quite uncomfortable.",US,2020-08-07
4,"nice, simple mask","I got these black masks mainly for my son since he tends to be more on the ""simple"" side of clothing. These black masks go with everything and aren't showy. They are comfortable (as far as masks go) and seem to do their job.",US,2020-08-21
4,Only missing a nose piece,"This is a fine mask, soft, comfortable, large enough to cover from the bridge of the nose to under the chin. However, with no nose piece, it doesn't fit as snugly. And as such, it doesn't help with glasses fogging. But that's it's only flaw.",US,2020-08-18
4,Really warm,"These masks are excellent, 3 ply, soft but Arizona is hot and this mask makes it hotter. We also have a 2 ply with a filter pouch which is actually cooler than this. Without the humidity and high heat, these would be great.",US,2020-07-13
4,Sizing doesn't follow sizing charts,"These are softer and more breathable than some other masks. However, following the measuring instructions, we ordered Xl for my husband and myself. They are fine for him; too big for me. I ordered L for myself. Washed, tried to wear on several occasions; but I was constantly tugging them down from the bridge of my nose. When I compared them to my husband's there was a miniscule difference. Requested a return.",US,2020-08-10
4,A little on the bigger size,These masks give you good coverage but they are a big too big. They didn‚Äôt have a choice for medium so I had to buy large so I knew they would be bigger. I would buy them again ifin they offered a medium choice,US,2020-10-10
4,Mask is ok but glasses fog easily.,This mask is well made and can be work for long period of times without discomfort. It would have been better if a flexible nose clip was sewn into the upper hem to keep the glasses fog to a minimum.,US,2020-10-06
4,Decent workout mask,"First mask I have been able to workout with. Great shape, fit, breathability. Mask does not suction into my mouth for lack of better word. I don't know that it will last long, while the mask is great the elastic for the ears is very flimsy, i have washed/dried once.",US,2020-12-02
4,"If you aren't a child in size, get at least a large","As far as sizes go, as a thin person with small head--- I should have gotten a large. Their medium size is really more for a kid sized head. The mask does not stretch comfortably over my ears at this size.

UPDATE: Although you still should be careful about selecting the mask sizes, Enerplex did me right and sent me larger ones at no cost. Gave the review a bump for excellent customer service.

Now that it fits correctly, it feels nice and sporty.",US,2020-08-19
4,No wire over nose,Fits good on a fat head and lots of hair bot no wire over the nose. I fixed it myself with a paperclip and some time and effort. Would've got 5 stars if it had a wire over the nose.,US,2020-11-11
4,3 Layer Face Masks,"Nice product, soft flexible and fit good. Like the 3 layers since that is what the Professional state that is what is needed for the Covid19. They are re-useable. Will buy again when needed.",US,2020-09-04
4,Good quality but size was inconsistent,"My 9-year old likes these masks a lot. However, because of the light color of the blue ones (stains and such really show up), we decided to buy a set of black ones too. We bought small for both, but they didn‚Äôt turn out to be the same size. The black were smaller than the blue and didn‚Äôt fit either my 6 year old or 9 year old well. It was weird and ended up a waste. With that said, the blues still are among my son‚Äôs favorite. The adult size (large) has been great.",US,2020-10-27
4,Not large,"Hoped these would be a bit larger. And there is no wire to mold mask around nose. The masks are soft. We intend to use with a second, high quality disposable mask.",US,2021-02-02
4,Good masks,"Very good masks, only 4 stars as my glasses do fog up occasionally since these don't have a wire for the nose to stay secured. But they work pretty well so they're my go to masks.",US,2020-12-06
4,Mask only has two layers not three,I only feel two layers of fabric. I am not sure if I am going to keep them.,US,2020-07-06
4,Comfortable but needs to be stretched for other faces and to tuck under glasses,Comfortable and can be stretched a little for larger faces and to tuck under glasses. I do however wish it would be large enough for this without having to stretch it.,US,2020-10-20
4,"Solid mask, recomended.","This is a good overall mask, its breathable, but still is protective, and is better than most of the masks I see random people wearing around.
The only flaws I've noticed are the new mask smell, which should wash out, and mainly that because of the relatively thin straps behind the ears, it can start to dig into you if you wear it for a whole workday. This is easily remedied by putting some kind of padding behind your ears, or perhaps using a strap behind your head. Other than that this is a good mask.",US,2020-10-26
4,Good fit,Fits my 9 yr old,US,2020-08-28
4,Nice face masks,"These masks are quite comfortable and fit well. I went off recommendations of other reviews and ordered the xl size because of having a big beard. I could have probably ordered a size large and been fine. Overall, nice masks and are comfortable.",US,2020-12-04
4,Needs slight adjustment in fitting well,The only reason that I gave a 4 star rating was because it was described as fitting 3yr -9yr olds. I purchased this product for a 4 yr and a petite 9 yr old and they didn‚Äôt fit well. All I had to do was tie small looped knots at the end of the ear loops and they fit fine. After doing that they fit well and we‚Äôre soft and comfortable for them to wear. The actual face mask part covered their faces well.,US,2020-09-29
4,Only 2 out of 3 were good,"Great masks for the price. Only reason it gets a 4-star is because one of the 3 masks was not made properly (one ear loop bigger than the other). I know meatloaf said ‚Äútwo outta 3 ain‚Äôt bad‚Äù, but it‚Äôs still not great...",US,2021-01-25
4,"Excellent Mask, soft and breathable","Really liked this mask, very soft, comfortable, and fits my face well. When I talk the fabric doesn't bunch up in my mouth like other face masks.",US,2021-01-30
4,Fine,"I must have ordered the wrong size by accident because they were too big for me, so I gave them to other family members with larger heads who made them work. I bought these before I discovered cheaper options at other stores, but these do the job I guess.",US,2020-12-12
4,Great product.,Great product and a nice price for three masks. Like that you can buy them in different sizes because most masks are one size. Bought these for my nine year old. The ear loops are a little to long to hold the mask snug around her ears but bought some silicon ear loop ties and now the mask is great just wish the masks were made from antimicrobial material.,US,2020-08-19
4,Fits well,"It fits well enough to get around your chin. A wire around the nose section would be good for those of us that wear glasses. You know, the fog up issue. Whish someone had a solution for having to smell your own bad coffee breath. I guess you could eat mints or dab on a little aroma oil.",US,2020-10-20
4,Does not feel like a 3 ply,"This mask is not thick at all, yet a 3 ply which is great. Droplets do fall off. When washing do not put in dryer, line dry. Very comfortable. Good it comes in sizes.",US,2020-08-06
4,Soft and comfy mask,"I have a small face and thought the youth/adult size would be perfect but when I talk, it pulls down from my nose. I need to order the next size up. There is not a wire nose piece to help hold it in place. The mask is soft and well made.",US,2020-09-09
4,"Good, but lacking in two vital concerns.","For the most part I like the masks, but there are 2 important areas that are lacking : 1) there is no moldable nose piece, and 2) there is no pocket for inserting a filter. If these limitations were corrected I would give the product 5 stars.",US,2020-07-31
4,Ear straps aren‚Äôt comfy and no nose bar for glasses fogging,"Only reason I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars are because this is missing a nose metal bar to help with glasses/sunglasses fogging and (more importantly) the ear straps are very basic and become uncomfortable over time, especially if you need to tighten the straps slightly to size the mask to your face.",US,2020-08-02
4,"Love these masks, if I have to wear them.","Product exceeded expectations. Very comfortable. Was using another style and didn't like the chemical smell they had. These are washable. Only had them for a few days, but using them exclusively now.",US,2020-07-31
4,Fits perfectly for adults,We ordered a medium and it did not fit our 6 year old. It was big. So we ended up using it for ourselves. These are perfect for adults. Great quality and fit.,US,2020-08-22
4,Nice product,"My husband likes these because the ear loops are more stretchy than others he's tried. I like that they don't need special washing, I can just throw them in the washer.",US,2020-08-17
4,Almost Perfect,"They aren't as breathable as a other double layers I've tried, but the are supremely comfortable. I would suggest they add a aluminum nose bridge for a better or more perfect fit. I will buy again, after having these for about 3 months and wearing daily and 4 days in Disney - these are near the top overall from the several I have worn.",US,2020-12-26
4,Good for fat face,Mask is okay. The xl size fits much better on my larger face. My only complaint is the ear straps seem weak and I don‚Äôt think they will last.,US,2021-01-06
4,A must for hot climates,"By far the most attractive breathable and comfortable mask I've worn. However, even with ordering a (Medium) it was still a bit on the larger side. That surprised me as I'm not a small girl; 5'7"" and 170lbs",US,2020-11-06
4,A little smaller than I expected,"These appear to work well, but run a little smaller than I expected based on the sizing chart.. I should have gotten the next larger size. There is no pouch for inserting a filter.",US,2020-08-10
4,Good,I bought these for my kids for school. They are soft and comfortable. They sit away from the child's mouth so they don't have to inhale fabric when they breath. The font pull my child's ears forward and they don't ride up into their eyes either. If I have to purchase more I would probably buy these kind again.,US,2020-09-16
4,"Poor quality, don't expect to last long","Comfort and breathability are fine, but disappointed in the quality of construction. I've only washed this mask once, on a gentle cycle, and the stitching is already giving out (see picture).

EDIT: The seller reached out to me and offered to replace the defective mask at no extra cost. I have adjusted my score to reflect their proactive customer service.",US,2020-11-16
4,Not what was expected,Very comfortable and soft to the skin. I thought I was getting 3 masks that were half light blue and the other half a dark blue. They were all light blue.,US,2020-08-24
4,Size,"Masks seem pretty good. Washed them in cold and hung dry when first got. But, I am average size adult male and got the Large. Seem to be a bit small in sizing. If any doubt, go with the EX Large instead of large. All in all, not disappointed.",US,2020-10-14
4,Comfort for all day wear,Follow sizing instructions before purchase. I'm normally an extra large guy so ordered extra large and they were too big.,US,2021-01-14
4,Comfortable but warm,They feel really comfortable and don't scratch like other masks that I've tried. They do however fog up my glasses and make my face feel like its in a light weight sweater.,US,2020-10-07
4,Love the sizing,"I have a smaller face, so I ordered a medium in this mask and it fits well. It doesn't slide around on my face. It is soft to wear also.",US,2020-10-26
4,"You have to wear masks, so might as well get used to it.","I hate having to wear the mask but realize it is necessary. My rating was of course impacted by the fact that I do not like wearing them. With that in mind these masks are sort, comfortable, and adjustable. Sometimes a little hard to breath normally with them on but probably no worse than any other. Overall seems to be a good mask, delivery was pretty prompt and all is well.",US,2020-09-05
4,Nice Fit,I am a male and ordered large. The fit is nice. But they don't allow any positioning at the top that will help stop glasses from getting fogged up.,US,2020-09-04
4,"Nice mask, but too large","My husband ordered these in XL, which were too big for me. According to the measurements I needed a large, which is what I ordered. The size difference between the two is insignificant, they almost identical. A medium would have probably fit well, but again, I went by the sizing chart. I feel like I constantly need to pull the nose up. They are nice masks, well made. My husband does like his.",US,2020-09-04
4,They fit my smaller face.,These work well for the most part. Just tend to slip down when I talk. Comfortable and wash well. I bought a second set because they work well. Deducted one star for slippage.,US,2021-01-14
4,Good masks for the price,We need masks right now and these aren't better or worse than the best I've used I guess. I can't really measure protective qualities but they fit and work fine. The price is good and I'm not disappointed in them.,US,2021-01-24
4,"Okay, but not for glasses wearer in winter...","I'm still looking for masks for glasses wearer, especially in winter. If you aren't cursed with glasses, these'll be fine.",US,2020-12-20
4,"Nice Material, but runs a little large","The material and look is great, but it's a little too big for me and keeps on dropping down which makes them pretty ineffective as I have to touch my face repeatedly.",US,2020-06-30
4,I‚Äôd say these are more large than extra large,"Even though these are supposed to be ‚Äúxl‚Äù they still aren‚Äôt as big as I‚Äôd like, so they lose a star. I like the design with the seam down the center so they stay off your mouth. I like the quality. However, for a guy with a big head, they aren‚Äôt very comfortable.",US,2020-09-08
4,Not sized for young children,"Bought these in a size small for my 4.5 year old son and they are too big! They fit me perfectly as a petite adult, and will be great for work but I am definitely disappointed in the fact that I‚Äôm going to have to figure out a way to alter these to make them work for my son.",US,2020-09-01
4,We have a winner,"Was looking for a large mask due to covid-19.
It works quite well, very comfortable.
My glasses don't fog up easily either.
Thanks.",US,2020-07-09
4,Kinda big,"Measured my face and bought the large, it was still pretty loose and kept falling down. Also not very breathable this served its purpose I suppose!",US,2020-10-14
4,A little large for kids.,"I really like this mask, it is comfortable and soft. The only problem that we had is that it doesn‚Äôt fit my 6 year old. We bought a size small and intended it to be used for my son for when he goes back to school, but it is a little bit and slides down on his face. For now we‚Äôre tying the ends until we can order smaller masks.",US,2020-08-01
4,Meh.,"I am not too sure how I feel about this 3 pack. I bought Skze Medium. And only one of them fit my face perfectly. All 3 were varying in size slightly, even though I bought size medium. I am not very satisfied with my order, as the other two slides off my nose when I talk with them on.

The one that did fit me was snug, breathable, and comfortable.

I wished the other two were the same.",US,2020-10-12
4,Very large but very comfortable,"These are even larger than I expected for an extra large mask. They‚Äôre comfortable though, even when worn for long periods of time.",US,2020-08-16
4,No metal nose piece,"This is a decent cloth mask, but I didn't read the description very well... there is no metal nose piece on these masks :(",US,2020-10-23
4,Excellent Customer Service,"The large masks I ordered were too small. I was just going to let my wife use them and look for something else, but I received an email from them wondering if I was happy with them. I replied telling them the problem. They wrote back quickly offering to ship me extra large masks. They arrived priority mail about two days later. They seem to take their customers satisfaction seriously. The masks are quite comfortable.",US,2020-09-21
4,A little small but still good.,The mask fits up and down but the width could be a little wider. The mask seals well and feels comfortable.,US,2020-10-29
4,Slippery Ear pieces,"these are extremely comfortable masks. However, if you wear glasses you will find your glasses constantly slipping on the ear pieces.",US,2020-09-17
4,"Worth the money, comfortable.",Fairly good fit and comfortable. Would have liked to have a metal tab across the nose to adjust to fit better. Still would recommend.,US,2020-07-12
4,Perfect! Even though I received the wrong color,"The size medium masks are perfect for my 14-year-old son; however, I ordered them in black and received white. The sticker on the package says black, but white masks were in the package. Keeping because the fit is perfect, and may try ordering again for extras.",US,2020-08-26
4,Very soft and comfortable,These are very soft and comfortable. They were a little bit for my 6 year old and too big for my 4 year old. We hopefully can adjust the straps a little because they are the softest ones I‚Äôve found,US,2020-07-29
4,It's a mask...,Does what it should. I just wish there was a wire across the top part to clamp around the nose a bit to help prevent glasses fogging up.,US,2021-01-05
4,Nice mask that is breathable,"Nice mask, but it tends to pill after machine washing. The inner lining is very soft. The ear loops are a bit long too.",US,2021-01-03
4,VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR THESE TIMES,"THE MASKS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR AND THE BANDS THAT GO AROUND ONE'S EARS ARE COMFORTABLE. WHEN I WAS WEARING MY READING GLASSES, THEY DID FOG UP A BIT, WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T GIVE A FIVE RATING. I AM HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE AND A GOOD VALUE.",US,2020-07-05
4,"Soft, comfy but stretch out a bit.","I like these a lot. My only complaint is that even though I have a large head, the mask is sometimes a bit loose.",US,2020-10-18
4,Good Masks,"I wish there were some masks that didn't fog up my glasses, but these masks are soft and comfortable and I'm happy with them.",US,2020-11-07
4,Very comfortable,Fit is comfortable and breathable fabric. Ear piece is arranged to hold mask comfortably in your face.,US,2020-10-21
4,"If you have a small adult face, you may want to buy a sz smaller.","Love everything about it but the adult sz it too big for my face, keeps falling down. Otherwise the material is soft and easy to carry and wear!",US,2020-11-22
4,Good Quality,"They are soft, comfortable and stretchy, I washed them a few times already and still look and feel good. I let them air dry. So far nice product.",US,2020-08-07
4,Sizing issue,"The only thing I dislike about this product was that size regulation isn‚Äôt like every other brand and that seems to be an issue with all brands. Not all brands follow the same size regulation. When it comes this mask, I‚Äôm actually a medium to large, but when it comes to the under armor performance mask, I am an extra large. So just be aware when purchasing and picking a size.",US,2020-09-19
4,Fits great. Almost too breathable.,"I got a size medium for me and my boyfriend, we both have small faces and the surgical ones just didn‚Äôt fit tight enough around our faces. These fit great and are super breathable, but with that being said I question the effectiveness of them. Still would recommend simply because of comfortable they are.",US,2020-10-29
4,Breathe easily,"This face mask looks good and is of a good weight, not too thick, even though it is two layers, making it easy to breathe. The only thing I think would make it better is to have a wire across the top to shape on the nose.",US,2020-08-20
4,Large enough that it covers my nose and chin,"This is the first mask that I have purchased that covers my nose and chin. I purchased the XL. These things are soft, comfortable and breathable. The only thing I wish it had was a flexible metal bar that I could use to better secure the mask to my nose. Otherwise, this is probably the best mask that I have purchased since the pandemic started.",US,2021-01-19
4,Good,"My first order was size medium and I just loved them they fit perfectly, so I order again same size and they were a bit bigger, they just didn‚Äôt looked the same. The eye part it‚Äôs like a big triangle looks nothing like my first order",US,2020-10-21
4,Foggy glasses,These are just as described. Only complaint I have with them is they do nothing to prevent my glasses fogging up. The disposable masks with the metal nose piece work better in that respect.,US,2020-07-11
4,Great but HUGE....,"Great mask but make sure you actually need the XL size. Here, XL really does mean XL.",US,2021-01-29
4,Received large not medium,"I ordered medium but got large. They still fit decently and they‚Äôre very soft so still 4 stars, but mediums definitely would have fit better.",US,2020-08-04

4,Fits large face,The fit is awesome for large face super comfortable ...it is truly an XL mask...but only a single layer...and no pocket for filter..I just tuck one in any ...just have to be careful when removing the mask...good buy,US,2020-06-14
4,Thin,Too big for my six year old but knotted the ear pieces and fit fine. Only ones he wants to wear right now,US,2020-08-25
4,So comfortable!,"Five stars for finally finding a mask that can be worn for several hours at a time with little to no discomfort. The fabric is soft, the mask stays in place, provides ample coverage and the ear pieces are very comfortable. Other masks pulled on my ears and caused pain after just a short time wearing them.",US,2020-08-26
4,these masks are well made,"These masks fit well for average size person, covers nose and mouth well..has a pocket for added protection if needed.",US,2020-12-21
4,Comfortable!!!!,This mask is comfortable and fits all size faces. It does the job and I have no regrets with the purchase.,US,2020-10-30
4,Almost Perfect,"These are awesome when you first put them on, but after a while they start to loosen and slide down. Kind of defeats the perfect huh?",US,2020-08-25
4,Good quality but...,"I feel they could add another layer to the mask for extra protection. Finding the perfect mask, that meets all recommended suggestions, is hard, but pretty happy with these. Bought these for the guys in my house and they really like them!",US,2020-08-20
4,Easy to breathe through,"Well made, easy to breathe, could be just a little larger for XL. Much better than paper masks.",US,2020-09-11
4,A bit loose,"I bought the Large and it was a bit loose on me, but my boyfriend likes these for that reason. I prefer a tighter fit.",US,2020-07-15
4,Comfortable mask,"The mask is soft, comfortable. The 3-ply construction should be effective, but the design leaves a gaps either side of my nose, which foggy my glasses and probably reduces effectiveness.",US,2020-07-28
4,Comfortable Masks,These masks are very soft and fit fairly well for me but a bit on the large side. Other than that theu do what they are supposed to.,US,2020-08-19
4,"Nice material, bit too big","I like the material and they seem very breathable. The only thing is they were a bit too large for my face. Not too much of a problem though, I'm just going to pull the strings back a bit and sew them to stay in place.",US,2020-07-17
4,Very comfortable. Fit well.,"Very soft and comfortable. I love the way they are cut. It stays out of my eyes.
I feel like they could be thicker, but it says they are 3ply.",US,2020-07-23
4,Finally!,"Have been ordering different masks, all too small. This one fits my large face/head with minimal tug on ears. Super soft. I ordered the XL size black.",US,2020-07-26

4,Not life changing but a keeper,"These aren‚Äôt life changing, but they‚Äôre better than the others I purchased and tried. I kept them.",US,2020-10-27
4,Fits and works well...,It's thicker so it does restrict your exhales but overall I liked it..,US,2020-11-17

4,Easy to wear,Lightweight and comfortable however holds moisture and became uncomfortable when wearing at work all day,US,2020-07-23

4,Comfortable,"Ok mask , they are comfortable but don‚Äôt stay in place when I talk",US,2020-11-19
4,Good mask,"Quality seems good, been using a couple weeks. It is breathable but my face does get kind of hot.",US,2020-08-21
4,Sturdy thick mask,"Does the trick, but I find it a little heavy, ergo hot when wearing it a long time.",US,2021-01-06
4,Nice quality. Fits larger child.,"*Updated: (tied knots in the loops and now they fit!) Fit 9 yr old perfect, too big for petite 7 year old (closer to 5/6 year old size). A little too snug for petite adult. Nice quality, very soft.",US,2020-09-07
4,Good masks for larger heads.Comfortable.I wish there was a nose clip and a place for filters though.,"Only reason for 4 stars is there is no nose clip or a place for filters. Is that a big deal? No, but it still would be nice. Other than that, very comfortable. My ears aren't pulled forward and the straps aren't tight. I'm glad I bought them.",US,2020-07-04
4,Reusable,"I have used the one-use masks, but they irritate my nose and a lot of times the ear loops break. These masks are comfortable, washable and fit around my ears well.",US,2020-12-07
4,Not same fit as the black masks,"I ordered both blue and black in the large size, and the blue ones fit looser than the black ones. Both packages show the size large on their labels, so I‚Äôm not sure why they fit differently. I will keep them, but probably not wear the blue ones as often.",US,2021-01-14
4,Off center stitching,The stitching is off center on two of the masks which is super annoying. It's still the best mask I've found though,US,2020-07-27
4,Comfortable adequate mask,Comfortable adequate nice looking mask competitively priced. Not n95 protection but nice cloth mask,US,2020-07-20
4,"Quality fabric, good breathability and fit.","They might be a little loose at first, but after a few runs in the washer and dryer they'll snug up just just fine. Bought these after I bought the ones at Costco, which looked cool, but ended up being too small.",US,2020-10-25
4,Too big for women‚Äôs face,"I was exciting to get these because of the good reviews but I order a large size thinking it would fit me normal since I am an adult but nope, this kept falling off my nose way too big. They fit perfect for my husband though",US,2020-07-24
4,"Great mask, but nor for someone with a flatter nose bridge",Very comfortable and breathable! My only complaint is that it is loose around the nose area since it doesn't have that metal nose piece (I have a flatter nose bridge). I do find myself pulling it up more than my other masks. I gave one to my boyfriend and this is his favorite. He has a taller nose bridge and he doesn't have the same problem as me.,US,2020-09-15
4,"XL fits me good, Made in vietnam","XL fits me good me good, made in Vietnam, be careful ordering don't click size 1st",US,2020-08-14
4,Details on size small.,"The small would be great for a child. I have had trouble because most adult masks are big on me. The small is a tad too small for me, a petite adult woman (5'1"") and definitely too small for my slim 14 year old son.",US,2020-08-21
4,It‚Äôs ok for the price,It‚Äôs a bit pricey for what you get. There is a lot of looseness near my ear and one side of the mask is soft and the other is hard.,US,2020-12-22
4,XL is much to large,"I think I have a wider profile compared to most people and thought I'd share a picture. As you can see the mask is much to large. I measured around 5.5"" close to 6"" and XL won't work for me.",US,2020-10-12
4,Perfect for adults who are not very large.,Although I hate wearing a mask these are very soft and comfortable. They fit my tiny face perfectly! I am a small adult so these are a perfect fit.,US,2021-01-11
4,comfortable,"2nd package ordered another.
I wish my eye glasses didnt fog up.",US,2021-01-22
4,No Metal Nosepiece,"with that said this is the most comfortable and well fitting mask ive used so far. measured my face and it fit perfectly. To fix the nosepiece problem, i unbent a small paper clip and poked it through the loop of the hem. It works great!",US,2020-11-04
4,Too small,The mask would have been nice but it was just too small and the next size up was way too big. The mask is also thick so it can be really hot to wear and is not very breathable.,US,2020-10-02
4,great product,Very well made and comfortable. Worth the price.,US,2020-06-05
4,Good mask,Good masks. I bought x-large and it is a bit big for me. I'm 55 yr old man and I would order a large next time. Would be good over a beard.,US,2020-08-11
4,Small was smaller than expected,"We ordered the 3-pack in small. They fit our 4-year old girl well, once we tied knots in the ear straps. Unfortunately the face height was too small for our 6-year old boy so it kept slipping off his nose, even though we had tied knots in the ear straps to fit him that direction. We ordered a pack of medium to see if those fit him better.",US,2020-08-27
4,Good mask,Like the masks being breathable and comfortable,US,2020-12-28

4,Good as long as the sizing is correct.,"Mostly good face masks when they are sized correctly.

The first 3 pack (size: Large) I ordered was good, the second 3 pack (size: Large) I reordered the same size and yet they seemed a bit small.

Not sure if the second pack was mislabeled as the smaller ones really hurt/pull on your ears when the sizing is not right.",US,2020-11-30

4,Soft and comfortable,The best mask I have had since Covid-19 started. I have bought at least 9 kinds since then!,US,2020-06-26
4,"Close, but not quite the perfect mask.","The mask is soft, washes well in cold water and fits to accurate size. It would benefit from having a wire nose piece to pinch tightly over the nose as my glasses fog up, and it tends to slip down when I'm talking. Otherwise, it's a comfortable mask.",US,2020-09-02
4,Soft material,Material is good and was breathable but didn‚Äôt seal well for me.,US,2020-09-11

4,Great but Sizing,"They are very comfortable and breathable...the sizing is a bit odd. Top is L, fits my husband well but is too large for me. The bottom is the medium which is A LOT smaller. It fits my 9 year old well so not a total loss. I wish there was a size in between though.",US,2020-10-30

4,Soft and comfortable mask,"This mask is super soft, very comfortable, and fairly easy to breath in.

4,OK product not outstanding,Ear bands are not tight enough. The company has improved its product and now deserves a 4 star review.,US,2020-09-02
4,A good choice for anybody who wants a little larger sized mask.,I would have rated this with five stars if it had a wire piece for the bridge of your nose to keep your glasses from fogging. It does run a little bit larger than the universal fit masks which is what I was looking for.,US,2020-07-31

4,Good,"When I receive these in the mail, the straps on 2/3 broke. However I contacted the seller and they immediately sent another pack over free of charge.

4,"Great Fit, but Hot","I love the feel and fit of these masks and have been using them regularly since they arrived. I find they can easily be adjusted either high or low on the bridge of the nose as well as the position under the chin. The elastic ear loops are completely comfortable, unlike so many others.

The only downside to these masks are that they are hot. They seem to retain a bit too much moisture from your breath. Not to the point of being soggy, mind you, but enough to feel a very heavy humidity. For short trips out, say a gas station stop or a quick run into a store, no problem. For longer outings they may become uncomfortable to some. I wore mine to my wife's doctor's visit a couple of days ago. We were in the facility - masks required - for about 1.5 hours and it was quite a relief to take them off at the car.

Your mileage may vary. My wife, for example, does not experience the same level of discomfort that I have with this mask at times. But then, I tend to get too hot quickly and she does not.

If you're like me, look for a mask with a valve. If a basic, washable cloth mask suits you, then this is an excellent choice. The 3-pack is quite handy, as there's always one available if the others are in the wash.

Recommended with caveats as above.",US,2020-06-21
4,"XL fits larger heads well, 3 pack is a good value","We got sets of these masks in both the large and XL sizes. The XL is about half an inch wider and half an inch taller. I wear a size 7.5 hat, which is large, but not extra large. The size large masks are snug around my ears. The size XL are more comfortable, but still secure. These masks do not have nose wires, but the stretchy hem and contoured fabric around the nose does help to keep my exhaled breath from from fogging up my glasses, especially on the XL mask that I can pull completely over my nose so my glasses sit on top of the mask to hold it down.

These masks are 3-layer, which is much better than 2-layer for protection. The 3 layers are fairly thin and breathable, though, so I can still breathe comfortably when briskly walking outdoors.",US,2020-06-16
4,Well made and comfortable but no nose wire,"These EnerPlex XL Size White Face Masks are well made and comfortable but there is no nose wire so my glasses fog up.

These are 3 layer masks with elastic around the ears. The mask is bound on all four sides with a ribbed, knit, fabric. The outside layer of fabric is a ventilated, knit, fabric. The inside layer is a jersey, t-shirt, knit. I cannot see the inner layer but the company says it is a tightly woven fabric. The workmanship is excellent and these masks are very comfortable.

My family has large heads and faces and this XL size fits everyone very well. My husband and one son have beards and although their beards come out the bottom a bit, these still fit pretty well on them.

My main issue is that there is no nose wire to bend and conform to your nose. Because of that, my glasses fog up quickly when wearing this mask. I solved the problem by applying one of these nose wires to the outside of the mask and it works well. https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Strips-Bridge-Bracket-Adhesive/dp/B087MZ5TGH/ Unfortunately, the adhesive on these metal strips don't hold up well to laundering so I have to put on a new one after I wash the mask. I will probably end up sewing a pocket onto the front of the mask to hold the wire in place permanently.

I struggled with rating these masks. Because the nose wire is pretty important, I wanted to rate them 3 stars. However, it's hard to find large size masks and these are large and very well made so I am rating them 4 stars with the caveat that you will likely want to apply a nose wire for the best fit.",US,2020-06-17
4,"XL fits larger heads well, 3 pack is a good value","We got sets of these masks in both the large and XL sizes. The XL is about half an inch wider and half an inch taller.

4,The small fits a 4 year old just fine,"The size Small, EnerPlex Premium Kids Mask fits a 4 year old just fine and is soft and comfortable enough that he didn't mind wearing it.

These are 3 layer masks. The outer layer is a soft, mesh-type, knit. The middle layer (although I cannot see it) is supposed to be a cotton blend. The inner layer (next to the child's face) is a knit, cotton blend that is slightly brushed so it feels really soft. The attached, elastic, straps are very soft and stretchy so they are comfortable behind the child's ears.

These masks can be machine washed in cold water and tumble dried on low heat and you get a package of 3.

Do note that there is no nose wire but they seem to fit snugly enough at the nose.

I'm delighted to find a mask sized for a child. Our city has become a hot spot for coronavirus and masks only work if everyone is wearing one. I'm not sure a 3 year old would be able to understand to keep the mask on and not to touch it on the outside but many 4 year olds can follow those instructions for a non-extended period of time. These masks are a good choice, IMO. They would block most droplets if the child coughed or sneezed.",US,2020-06-27
4,Perfect for smaller faces,"These EnerPlex Youth/Adult Small Size Blue Face Masks are perfect for smaller faces.

These are 3 layer masks. The outer layer is a soft, mesh-type, knit. The middle layer (although I cannot see it) is supposed to be a cotton blend. The inner layer (next to your face) is a cotton blend knit that is slightly brushed so it feels really soft. All sides of the mask are bound in self fabric. The attached, elastic, straps are very soft and stretchy so they are comfortable behind your ears.

These masks can be machine washed in cold water and tumble dried on low heat and you get a package of 3.

Do note that there is no nose wire but they seem to fit snugly enough at the nose.

I'm delighted to find a mask sized for smaller faces. Regular sized masks just swallow my daughter's face but these are a very good fit. Our city has become a hot spot for coronavirus and masks only work if everyone is wearing one. Because these are 3 layer and stretch to fit snugly on the face, these masks are a good choice, IMO. They would block most droplets if you coughed or sneezed (as long as you are wearing it correctly so that your nose and mouth are covered.)

The truth is, social distancing and frequent hand washing are our best defense against coronavirus but for times when you must go to the grocery store, bank, gas station, etc, a mask will protect others in case you are unknowingly infected. If everyone is wearing a mask, we are ALL protected.",US,2020-07-02
4,"Nice masks, washable.","I got the EnerPlex face masks in XL because my husband has a large head. Fortunately I can wear these too. The only color available at that time was white or I would‚Äôve gotten a different color, but white is okay.

These are comfortable, especially compared to some masks which are stiffer. They came through the wash in good shape. Instructions are to wash before wearing the first time. Do not use fabric softener. I would wash in non-toxic, unscented detergent because this is going to be over your nose and mouth.

I read that the lining is treated with Agion. Supposedly this contains copper and silver, which is antimicrobial, ‚ÄúAgion is designed to automatically release its antimicrobial components ONLY when conditions for bacteria growth are present.‚Äù

This seems to be a good product. If you are in a high-risk environment, consider wearing a face shield plus the mask.",US,2020-06-26
4,Easy to wear without feeling too tight,"These are comfortable cloth masks.
No they do not have the metal in them to make a bit of a tighter seal around the nose.
So if you wear glasses I would imagine they might have issues with fogging up.
I don't wear glasses so it is not an issue for me.
I do however have issues with some masks being simply too tight and difficult for me to not go into an asthma attack.
This one I can wear for the amount of time I am out running my errands and so far knock on wood I have not had any issues .
I got the M thinking would be a better fit for my teens since many are simply too large for them.
This is a decent size that even dh can wear fine so I can not imagine what an adult large is but for us the Medium is perfect for everyone in the house.
Is not too tight on the ear loops but still stays on well.",US,2020-06-30
4,Snug Fit,"After going through the majority of the COVID-19 crisis with a homemade mask made from two layers of an old pillowcase, it's nice to have something that's better made, better looking and better fitting.

These are very basic - plain white, three layers. They fit snugly over my mouth, chin and up the bridge of my nose so I feel secure when I go out in public. The fabric is soft, slightly stretchy and feels both comfortable and breathable.

Nothing special, but they definitely get the job done.",US,2020-06-17
4,"Good fit, slightly small","These face masks are the best fitting masks I've used. They don't fog up my glasses and fit my larger head. The only issue is they are almost too tight and my head isn't even that big. So I'd recommend ordering up a size so they don't fit too tight.

These are pure white and stain easily but that's actually a good thing because they need to be washed regularly and the white gives the appearance of being clean. These can be bleached as well since there is no color to them. Elastic seems to be good quality and should hold up well over time. Overall, these are very nice but I'm not sure the sizing is right. I like the 3 pack, it allows me to always have one ready to go when the other 2 are dirty or in the wash.",US,2020-06-17
4,Surprisingly good for the price,"I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect from these, but I was pleasantly surprised. They are large, soft, and comfortable. I upgrade the protection of masks by placing a disposable shop towel over the mask and holding it in place with a section from nylon pantyhose (these are ideas from the internet, not my original).

But that‚Äôs JustMe. (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)",US,2020-06-18
4,A bit warm but comfortable against the skin,"These masks do feel good against the skin. I like that you can get them in different sizes instead of a one-size mask that may or may not fit. Overall, they're pretty comfortable to wear and they're easier to breathe in than some others we've tried. And that's also where the only real drawback comes in. I can easily breathe in, but when I breathe out it feels like the warm air is trapped inside and it gets pretty warm inside the mask. Considering the current conditions, pulling the mask away from my face isn't really a good idea, so it gets uncomfortable after a bit, especially if it's warm wherever I am. I have noticed that it isn't as bad when it's cooler. Basically, these are comfortable as far as the way the fabric feels against your skin and they are well made. If they could find a happy medium for when a person exhales, these would be darn near perfect.",US,2020-08-27
4,Good Coverage and Very Comfortable,"These masks fit their description. They're comfortable and very soft against the skin. Their material is lightweight and feels like what a sport t-shirt is made of. The ear loops are soft and stretchy and allow the masks to rest on the face comfortably. They are also true to size. I'm not sure how much protection they offer during the COVID-19 pandemic. I suppose it's the same level of protection as a bandanna or scarf. They hold up well to machine washing and drying, which is a plus. I only wish that the manufacturer would make a pocket for a filter on these masks. That would make them much more effective for what most people are wanting them for.

4,Comfortable & Breathable,"Considering, the current state of things with COVID we will likely wearing face covers for the foreseeable future. My husband has a full beard and it is difficult to get a good/solid fit. These work perfectly...and are fairly thin and breathable.

The 3-layers: Shell Layer: 100% Polyester DWR; Middle Layer: 65% Polyester 35% Cotton; Inner Layer: 65% Polyester 35% Cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent",US,2020-06-27
4,Seem well made,"This is a nice sized mask for preschoolers and older toddlers. It is well sewn and a good size. If we are in a situation where masks are necessary ( and we are, and I hate it ) I want my granddaughter to be safe and comfortable. Will this nightmare never end ? :(",US,2020-06-28
4,"Works great, fits fine","I have a problem with almost every face make, this one included, in that I wear glasses and trying to breathe through a mask and NOT have my glasses fog up is just unrealistic. I definitely prefer these soft material face masks over the disposable paper ones. I have gaiters that I use as well, but the fact that they cover my neck just adds to the heat during summer. These are the best type of mask for me.",US,2020-07-03
4,Soft and comfortable,"These are soft and comfortable to wear. They are a decent thickness and somewhat warm to wear in summer heat. They fit a ten/small woman well; they are especially comfortable around the ears. The fabric is nice and soft.

Despite reminding my husband not to put them in the dryer, he put them in anyways. They did quite well. Shrinkage was surprisingly minimal.",US,2020-07-10
4,"Nice, soft masks.","These masks are made of a very nice cottony soft material, it almost looks like wearing underwear on the face :)
They are comfortable and well shaped to provide some space in front of the mouth. However I still have the issue of my glasses getting fogged up. I wish there was a shaped part or some other mechanism to prevent breath from traveling upwards under the mask.",US,2020-06-24
4,"The cotton shrinks a little, which is a good thing...","... before washing these masks, they were too large. Washing them in hot water shrunk them just enough so they fit just right. The fabric is extremely soft and comfortable. Because the masks are 3-ply (have 3 separate layers of fabric), they will do a better job of protecting my husband and me from the virus.",US,2020-06-18
4,Not tight around nose,My son loves his mask. He is only two and isn't required to wear one but if course he wants to because everyone else is. I like that it is just his size and it is so soft it doesn't bother him. The only reason I give it a for star is because it doesn't for well around his nose when he talks or opens his mouth it moves off of his nose. It doesn't have a right grip around it and he is always readjusting it which defeats the purpose,US,2020-08-03
4,"Teen Yes, Young Child Maybe Not",These cloth masks are very well made and are nicely stitched with breathable fabric. The ear loop bands are narrow and not too tight. The youth size is a decent fit for teens but it may be too large and gape at the nose for much younger children.,US,2020-07-02
4,Quality masks but inconsistent sizing on 2nd order,The quality and material where exactly what we were looking for. They are very comfortable to wear. I would have given 5 stars except for the size inconsistency in my 2 orders. As you can see in the picture I received my first order of 3 large masks which came with a wider ear elastic (the top picture). These were great and perfect for my husband for work. He liked them so much I placed a second order for the same size large masks. I received the masks (in the lower picture) which are smaller and have thinner ear elastics. I was upset about the size inconsistencies but since they fit me I will keep the second order. I have recommended them to family with caution as they may get masks that are different in size. They are made in Vietnam. I would order another set if I knew I was getting the wider ear elastic with the larger sized mask for my husband. Both packages were sealed and labeled as large. Not sure maybe the first order was really an XL in a ‚Äúlarge‚Äú label package??? I will watch other reviews for inconsistencies to see if I should place another order.,US,2020-06-06
4,Soft and nice quality,"These masks are made with a nice soft material that is gentle to the face.  These are snug and a little small for my youth kids, but for a smaller child, these would fit nicely.  Great quality and love that they are easily washable and reusable.  Should have gotten medium size.",US,2020-08-06
4,Who was that masked man?,"Excellent and roomy masks with the added feature of machine washability
Please remember, you don't wear a mask to protect YOU; you wear it to protect others

4,Great kids mask!,Foys my kids great. Doesnt pu on the ears. Well made. Bee. Through a few dozen washings and no issues.,US,2020-08-29
4,Fit is good,"I'm a big guy with a beard. These cover my mouth and nose pretty good. Decent quality, not medical but still decent.",US,2020-06-15
4,"good quality, money's worth","Very breathable, comfortable, perfect fit for me and my husband. hasn't worn out after multiple hand washes., dries fast. Will buy again. I highly recommend",US,2020-07-11
4,"Ok, but smaller than advertised","They seemed ok, but they are not nearly as large as they claim. Based on the measurements they show on their pictures, the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù size should have fit my face just fine. But they won‚Äôt even cover my chin and nose at the same time. My face measured 5.5‚Äù.

However, I decided to return the large and try the XL, as they seemed ok otherwise. The only part they lack on first observation was an adjustable nose piece.",US,2020-06-21
4,Mask for Every Task,"These masks can fit into any lifestyle. They are very comfortable and fit snug but not tight on your face. They kind of have a cloth-mesh feel so they are good for working out/running if you need to wear one while doing so. They look very stylish and I've gotten compliments on them from people who wear the disposable ones. If they don't fit right the first time you put them on, it may be upside down as that happened to me.

There are three downsides to these masks. They do not have a nose clip, so the mask can slide down pretty easily. Also after a few washes, I've noticed the elasticity of the material is starting to wear making the masks less snug. I don't know if this will get worse as I wash them more, but just an observation from how my mask fits now vs when I first got them. The ear loops are not adjustable, so be sure to order the correct sizing.

Overall I would recommend these if you are looking for a comfortable mask that can be used for different activities and abide by the mask laws.",US,2020-10-07
4,Decent cloth/fabric face mask,"I bought these knowing that face masks (whether effective or not) would soon be mandatory where I live ... and now they are.

These masks are pretty comfortable, though just like any mask, they take a little getting used to. The coverage is good and they don't feel like they're gonna rip your ears off or make your ears stick out like you're ready for take-off on a windy day. The elastic ear bands are a bit on the cheap side. That's not a big deal if you can locate some extra elastic in case they need replacing.

The instructions say to wash before wearing, and I suggest you do so. Let them air dry if you can, they'll probably last a little longer that way. I live in Arizona, so with the low humidity, they dried real quick. Overall the quality is in the ""better"" range.

Stay healthy.",US,2020-06-30
4,Nice Masks,"I ordered these based on the many, many thousands of reviews and was just trying to find washable masks for my family that weren't super expensive or always disposable. I ordered black for them and blue for me. They fit very well and my kids really like them, don't seem to have any issues. They wash up well and they feel really soft and they are great quality material to provide that extra safety we were looking for in a mask. I found for myself personally that if I wear them beyond an hour or so they make my face itch all around the edges of the mask. It is so frustrating that I was in a meeting for over 2 hours and I couldn't wait to take it off. It feels so soft and comfortable and I can breathe in it, but I can't wear it for long periods of time. Disposable masks don't have this affect on me. The other complaint is where the seam runs down the middle of the mask, there is a gathering that makes it dimple around the nose and upper lip area that it looks bizarre and I keep stretching it to make it not do this. I'm not sure if they are too big for my face - they cover a large area almost up to my eyes and to my ears. My kids, including my 20 year old, like them a lot. I'm the only one who actually prefers the disposable ones for comfort and long term wearing. I will hopefully find some cloth ones that I can use.",US,2020-11-14
4,Pretty Decent Mask,"I bought these because the masks we had made at home I really didn't like. These are made of a nice looking lightweight fabric that is relatively comfortable. The elastic for the ears is a round ""cord"" like kind. I wasn't sure how it would pull on my ears but even on my big head and ears it seems to be comfortable. There is no wire around the nose to squeeze and make a secure fit but I knew that going in and I'm ok with that. The fabric doesn't seem to attract lint or dust and is easily cleanable if it does. Wearing a mask takes a long time to get used to so I'm not sure that any other mask I try on would feel any better. You're always going to be blowing hot air in your face and and fogging your glasses. I don't think there is any way around that. These are no different. All-in-all these will work for me until this madness ends.",US,2020-06-24
4,Very soft and comfy. Very good fit. Almost TOO easy to breathe through.,"They seem great. They are very soft and easy to breathe through. It is this, however, that makes me rate it lower. They are TOO easy to breathe through. I am unsure of how much protection I am offered from the environment, although I am reasonably certain that the environment is protected from me. I am rating them a 4 (I would give another half star, but there is no option to do that - so really, 4.5 is my rating) because they did not come with a filter pocket. I was trying to find exactly how much filtration they offer and really could not find any information on how much protection the inner layer has against particulates (does it block up to 30%, 50% 80%, etc). Cambridge Analytics did a study on different materials and their efficacy against viral sized particulates, and the material they suggested that works best seems to come close to what the Seller has used. I have asked the seller exactly how much protection they offer. If they come back with an answer that satisfies me, I will change my rating to a 5. They really are nice masks and very comfy. I would trust these for protection from fire, smoke, etc. We have a problem with brush fires in my area, and these would do well with that.",US,2020-07-02
4,"Soft, comfortable mask","I've been using the disposable masks forever, but I got tired of the fabric falling apart and tickling my face, so I finally broke down and went on the hunt for some reusable cloth masks. I have a large head (size 8 hat), and I followed the website's size measurement instructions, which recommended the XL size. So I ordered it and it was way too big, hanging down off my nose. I ordered the L size instead and it fit a little too small, but I kept them because it's better to be tit and form a good seal.

The masks are almost too comfortable and breathable, in that they reduce my confidence that they're offering sufficient protection. They seem kind of like underwear for your face. Nonetheless, I need a mask that I will wearing all the time, even while working out at the gym. I just hope that these masks are protecting me, so it's a bit of a leap of faith.",US,2020-10-26
4,Single ply,"These masks are soft and wearable, but they are a single ply stretchy fabric which bothers me. My homemade masks are minimum 3 ply to prevent microbes from getting in or out. This one is mostly a fashion statement. I prefer cotton, 3 ply with a nosepiece and replaceable filters and will look for those. Public health is everyone's business, wear a mask you morons.",US,2020-09-17
4,Passes candle/lighter test but not light test,"I cannot blow out a candle/lighter with these masks on, which is my go-to effectiveness test for masks. However, I can see light through the gaps in the threads, so that makes me a bit uneasy. Also, these masks don't have a nose wire, so I will probably add them myself. The masks are very comfortable.

I appreciate the 3 layers and softness and the fact that these, like I said, pass the flame test. Overall, I'm fairly happy with them. However, if you're wanting the best possible protection, I recommend buying cotton masks with a filter layer from Etsy :)",US,2020-09-30
4,Comfortable But Not Snug Enough For Me,"Initially I liked this mask because it has a larger coverage area, it is soft, smells good and is breathable the ear loops are much more comfortable than my previous mask. My only problem is because it is a bit large and the material is a bit slippery it moves alot - especially when I look down or turn my head. Unfortunately the mask slides up and touches my eyes or even covers my eyes and I have to keep adjusting it over and over which is a pain. I tried twisting the strings for the ear loops to make it tighter but it puckers at the sides and creates a slight opening thus it doesn't sit flat on my face. I will either have to find something to tighten the ear loops from behind the ear so the mask doesn't move so much or give them to my husband to try as he is a larger guy and they might fit him better than me.",US,2020-08-28
4,I can see!,"I am a petite female and all of the masks I had would come up so high that they would ride up into my eyes. I decided to try the kids size based on another review (thank you!). These are nice and soft. They fit pretty well- when I talk they shift, so not ideal if I was working, but fine for running to the store. I took off 1 star because the elastics around the ears have already started to stretch out. I have had these about a week and have only worn for a couple short periods of time, so I can't imagine them lasting over time. I haven't washed them yet so I can't speak for longevity, but it's really nice to be able to see again!",US,2020-10-17
4,NO WIRE!,I was disappointed to find that there is no wire at the top of the mask. This is important to shape it to your nose to get a tight seal and keep your glasses from fogging up under certain conditions. But Ile try using it anyway. At least it was more affordable than most. The three pack means I can give two to others.. I have straightened out a paper clip and worked it into the seam over the nose and then shaped it to my nose . This is an improvement that is needed!,US,2020-07-10
4,Adding a Nose Bridging wire,"I wanted a non cotton 3 ply mask that would wick moisture better then cotton.
Without a nose bridging wire I have a gap between my nose and high cheek bones under my eyes with these mask.
I took a large paper clip, straighten it, cut it shorter. Then I was able to insert the paper clip , with some heavy pushing and wiggling, into the upper edge of the sewn nose hem. Then shaped it over my nose and upper cheeks to shape it properly to may face. It does take some force to shape it over your nose and cheeks.
I did 2 of the 3 mask. The first one was easy to guide through the hem. The second one was more difficult. I'm not sure if this will effect the durability of the mask but it was not going to suit my purpose without the wire.",US,2021-01-24
4,Form fitting!,"Like many other glasses wearers out there 2020 was a terrible year for me. Most masks either fogged up because they were too lose, or would pull on my ears because the mask was too tight. I am a heavier set guy so I need a mask that doesn't look like I just placed a small napkin over my face, but not large enough that it might as well be a bandana. Then I bought these in LG and perfect fit! They look very sleek too, no folds and wrinkles when wearing.
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the inside cotton material in the mask isn't the most breathable. I would have preferred if they used the same material on the inside as they do the outside.",US,2021-01-22
4,Work well If You get the correct fit.,"Things I like. Comfortable. Soft. Like all mask, they will fog my glassses. I have got some metal stick on things to help close the gap beside my nose. Even with these, I still get some fogging.

Fit. I got the large for me and medium for my wife. Hers fit her perfect. Hers are too small for me and the large one are a bit too big. Being a bit too big contributes to glasses fogging. I have tried four different mask including these and have not found any that will not cause some fogging of my glasses.",US,2020-12-08
4,"It works, but it‚Äôs a bit tight around the ears. Size listed is smaller than expected","The masks are very soft and don‚Äôt irritate my face like some of the medical paper masks do. I do, however, don‚Äôt like how tight these masks are. I ordered XL masks and they still feel tight. As pictured, the package has two stickers , ‚ÄúM Size Black Face Mask 3-Pack‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnerPlex Premium XL 3-Ply...ork Outdoors -XL (3-Pack). They basically slapped an XL sticker on a Medium mask pack. I will have to alter this mask in order for it to fit comfortably.
Breathability: This is a thick (3-Ply) mask so breathability is not the worst but I wish it was thinner.",US,2020-10-18
4,Mending previous review,"Reviewing other comments I purchased these mask because it was said the mask stay in place which I find not to be true. When talking the mask does slip off my nose, and the size i order per the chart, does not fit securely. I do not recommend

***because I could not wear these mask, I gave to my grandson who is a senior in high school. He loves these mask over others I have purchased. I guess it‚Äôs all trial and error when ordering mask for that fit. I must be fair in only to say, you‚Äôll need to just try for yourself if these mask are a fit for you. My grandson did say, it‚Äôs easy to breathe, and cooler wearing, in school for 4 hours. For me it‚Äôs a one star, however for my grandson it‚Äôs a four.",US,2020-08-22
4,needs Nose bar,"UPDATE: They need little metal flex bar on the nose. and it would be 5 Stars as this just fogs up my Sun Glasses! other then this Fine.. so I may Sew my own on the nose part.. from old N95 mask..
This is always a Shot in the Dark buying such online.. BUT IN THIS CASE I'm happy with the quality.. I also have gotten some Strap for later on.. and should work fine with this.. I am happy with the Shape, Cloth Used, and it fits just right ""med Adult"" and nice to use!",US,2020-09-13
4,Solid product.,"I have purchased these mask several times for myself and my two sons. They are comfortable, breathable and pass the candle test. They wash well, but do shrink a bit if you put them in the dryer. The insert that comes with the packaging does mention that air drying is best. These are definitely one of the better cloth masks that I have tried. I did get one miss-sized order but I was able to give those to my husband and the masks fit him perfectly. I wish these came in more colors.",US,2020-12-07
4,Being able to order a size that fits a large head with a beard is a huge plus,"This is my third mask, and the first that actually fits. I'm a big guy, and I have a beard, so the average masks I tried before did not fit well at all.

Also, this mask is very soft and breathable. It's hard to know how much the ""breathability"" reduces the protection it provides.

The one negative I'll mention is that this mask does not have an aluminum strip to make it fit against one's nose, so it tends to fog up glasses.",US,2020-07-28
4,I like this mask!,"I like this mask. I bought it as an alternate from my professional mask to use when necessary to go out in public like the grocery store, etc. It's lightweight and easy enough to wear. I like that it is machine washable and, I like the solid black that can be worn with nearly any color. The price was right for a 3 pack and it was delivered the NEXT DAY!!!
I choose 4/5 star vs a full 5/5 because I wish I could insert filters. All in all it serves my purpose.",US,2020-07-08
4,"Finally, a big enough mask","After many failed attempts at finding a mask that was large enough, that wasn't too hot and didn't pull on my ears, I finally found it with these.
Pros: They are larger than anything I've seen so far in this style of mask. They pass the candle test yet feel breathable. There is virtually no strain on my ears from the loops and the mask fits snugly enough.
Cons: Fogs glasses, I wish they had a nose bridge piece. They might be too big for some, but I was looking for big and comfortable.",US,2020-09-02
4,"At last, masks for regular sized people!","I'm an average american guy, a little on the husky side, having a short beard. I'm not a petite asian model. I ordered mask after mask and they are all too small especially if I start to talk, they pull down off my nose. The XL size here fits. Just. It's not at all too big, in fact it could be a tad bigger. But it fits. Finally! If I talk with my teeth clenched so I don't move my chin, it doesn't even slip off my nose.",US,2020-07-22
4,Better the others but fogs glasses,"I the large mask (wear a 7/14 hat) and while it fits, I wish it was maybe 1/4 wider to take a tad more pull off my ears. I have to wear a mask for 0 hours a day so maybe I should get one of the behind the head bands. The only real complaints I have is I wish they had a bendable nose strip, to reduce my glasses fogging up and they are noticeably warmer than the disposables I was wearing. Overall they look nice and seam to be well constructed.",US,2020-09-17
4,Medium was way too big for a small adult!,"I am an adult woman (the account is under my husband's name), average height at 5'4"", but my face is small. I thought the medium would be good since it is supposed to be for youth or small adult. Nope, too big! I tied little knots on either side and it fits fine now. Same thing for my petite 13 year old daughter. I am not sure how this mask can fit a child. Size down!",US,2020-08-08
4,Fits big guys,"I'm a normal size guy but some say I have a big head; hah. These do fit and are comfortable across nose, under chin, and around ears. A downside is that there is no stiffener across bridge of nose so big gaps appear there; fogs goggles, glasses, and safety glasses, as wells as letting in a lot of room air. Ends up these are my go to masks, but am desperately pursuing some fix for the nose gaps.",US,2020-07-29
4,Only black on the outside.,"These are just disposable masks, like most any other disposable mask. But they do fit consistently and do have a metal band across the nose. However, the one thing I don't like is that the inside is white. While I don't reuse the masks, per se, I don't like taking it off somewhere and having to hide the white side because it looks dirty from make-up, etc.",US,2021-01-26
4,"Great construction, hard to distinguish inside from outside","The biggest issue with these masks is that it is hard to tell the inside from the outside which is very important for obvious reasons. I ordered both a white set and a black set and they are the same way. I will have to stitch in some colored thread to my masks. Other than that, they are well made and fit comfortably. They had also sent me the wrong size initially but quickly sent a replacement set.",US,2020-08-13
4,Comfy masks,"I really like the masks for its comfort and the room inside so that your lip isn't touching the fabric all the time especially when you have chapstick or lip balm on. Unfortunately after washing it twice, I found a small rip on one of the masks. It's an easy fix but just disappointed to know that it can rip easily. But still, one of the most comfiest masks I've ever worn.",US,2020-11-11
4,"Comfortable, but inconsistent sizing","My kids (6 and 9) and my Husband think these are very comfortable. The fabric is smooth and soft and thick. They were far too hot for me and made me sweat while wearing them. But if the kids like them, then I‚Äôm happy.
My only complaint is that I ordered two packages of the same size (Small) and they are significantly different in fit. One pack fit snug to their faces and the other pack was very loose and fell down off their faces. I had to tie knots in the ear loops to make them usable...so they don‚Äôt get a full 5 stars from me.",US,2020-10-09
4,"Soft, Comfortable, Nice Fit",I have worn this mask for almost two weeks and they wear well. The mask is soft and comfortable. Because I have a small face I bought the medium size. The medium size looks very small but it fit my face well but if I were to order this mask again I would order the large size so I would have just a little more room. A person with an average size face should buy the large size mask. They wash well by hand and dry quickly. Good deal for the price.,US,2020-10-05
4,Very comfortable face maskm,"Product stated ""Outer layer DWR 100% Polyester, Middle Layer Cotton Blend, Inner Layer NanoFine Cotton Blend"". Unfortunately I expected the inner layer to be 100% cotton. It was 65% cotton and 35% polyester. I was looking for a cotton inner layer due to skin sensitivity. The company immediately responded to me and appears to be very reputable.",US,2020-10-08
4,Runs small,"These are great masks! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I bought the Lg size expecting them to fit my husbands normal sized head. The sizing seems to run small. It covers his face, but only if he doesn‚Äôt talk. When he talks it either pops off his chin or his nose. I would but these again, but would size up. Very comfortable and easy to breathe in.",US,2020-08-20
4,These a very nice quality.,"I really been looking for a mask to fit my face. I'm a rather large guy to be honest and this seem to fit the bit rather well. I think the only thing I wish these masks had was either a option for a filter and something to help keep it attached to the nose a bit more like a wire or something. Other wise perfect. It fits well, not to snug but just right.",US,2020-08-18
4,"Nice, I highly recommend, but narrow.","I have a melon head, so I may be somewhat unique. The material is soft, it seems to be very well made, the height is perfect, but the width seems narrow, to the point it is somewhat difficult to stretch over my ears. Sizing is by height (bridge of nose to chin), but it seems they should factor in the width as well. Again, it may be because I have a large head. I do recommend this product",US,2020-07-20
4,Size small=youth 3-9,"Size small= youth
It is comfortable for both me, a small woman, and my 9 year old.
I am attaching a photo of the sizing description on the package since it wasn‚Äôt quite clear when I ordered.",US,2020-08-20
4,Very comfortable but the fabric was different than in the product description,Very comfortable face mask - I had been looking for a larger mask and the XL size was just what I was looking for. The ear loops were not tight enough but that was fixed by tying a knot in each to make them shorter. Biggest concern was that the fabric was not as advertised - it was supposed be one outer layer of polyester and two inner layers of cotton. But the two inner layers were both poly / cotton blend. It makes the mask hotter to wear. I am going to keep them and wear them but I was disappointed at that.,US,2020-08-08
4,More than I wanted to pay but my 10 yo wears these at school all day and says they're good.,Tried the black came back to buy the White. My 10 yo boy wears them all day at school and says they are comfortable. The price was little more than I'd like to pay but if they work well it's worth it. Hand Washes easy dries nice outside on a sunny day. Takes about 40 minutes on delicate in the dryer.,US,2020-11-28
4,Good Fit for Larger Faces,"Large enough to fit over beard. I've bought twice. Same SKU/bar code but second pack had slightly shorter (elastic) ear loops, resulting in mild ""Dumbo ears"". No wire, so need to position top edge of mask ""just so"" to avoid fogging glasses. Still, best I've found so far, and will keep buying.",US,2020-12-18
4,Comfortable,"Buyer beware. This mask is very comfortable and has a nice cut. I also like that it doesn't press up against my mouth and nose. However, my package said this contains Agion as an antimicrobial agent. I don't know what this is. I looked on-line but didn't get a clear answer. I also sent an email to the company asking if Agion off-gasses, washes away with time, or can be harmed by certain detergents. They have not replied.",US,2021-01-18
4,Size was the only problem.,"I measured over the 6"" for an XL mask when I put it on it was small, talking normally the mask started to pull off my nose, no matter what the mask kept getting pulled below my nose. So I will have to pass these on to those in my family with a smaller face LOL. Everything else though is great, very comfortable although I think the thickness of the mask may pose an issue in the hot sun. Also no nose adjustment piece so there may be a lot of fogging up of glasses.",US,2020-07-13
4,Soft and silky smooth!!,These masks are more comfortable than any other mask I've tried. The material is a soft silky smooth mesh material and it feels good on the face. The shape makes it easy to breathe because it's not bugging your nose and mouth. There is a pocket of air that allows comfort and breathability throughout the day.,US,2020-10-30
4,Blue is not the best,"These are my absolute favorite masks so far. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô tall woman and apparently my face is small, and these masks don‚Äôt cover my eyes. Also they‚Äôre very comfortable and look well made! But the blue fabric reminds me of old school little boys underwear. I‚Äôm trying out the black and will update this review.",US,2020-11-24
4,Decent alternative to disposable masks.,"I liked that I was able to choose the size, but as an adult with an average size head (I guess) the large masks felt a little loose. With that said, I was able to breathe more easily than a surgical disposable mask when I was active. The only downside is that I felt the need to periodically adjust the mask as it kept slipping down.",US,2020-09-17
4,Mask part is good for small faces but needs ability to adjust,"I like this mask and the material and so does my little one -- but the ear pieces have no ability to adjust out of the box. We had to tie them, and eventually use our own method to adjust them, or else the mask hangs really loose.
That being said, the mask part itself fits really well on a small child's face!",US,2020-08-19
4,"Nice, but a little loose on my wife","We like these masks. I'm a 5'9"" man and my wife is a 5'4"" woman. Both of us are thin. The mask seems to fit me just fine, but my wife complains about the fact that it seems loose on her face. Also, I'd prefer an embedded thin metal strip that could form around my nose so that it doesn't fog my glasses as much.",US,2020-08-13
4,I felt less claustrophoebic in this mask than the typical disposable ones.,"I would have rated it a full 5 stars except that it said ""wash before using"" and I was desperate. I had a doctor's appointment which required me to wear a mask and I had run out of my disposable ones ... so, I wore the new mask without washing it first. So, I have no idea how well it will hold up to the washing process.",US,2020-07-22
4,Good but hot,"The material is soft and the elastic ear loops are of good length. There is no bendy bit for a nose, but that is clear enough before ordering. However, like all such masks, these are hot. Perhaps that will be an endearing feature in the winter! If one is able to wear a shield, that would be a better option.",US,2020-08-23
4,Breathable,"First: I chose a Medium. I am a female, 5‚Äô2‚Äù 135lb . This fits perfect. I don‚Äôt get hot under it mainly because it is breathable and light weight and does not cause upper lip perspiration. As far as ‚Äòfogging‚Äô well I can only say, in my opinion, it still fogs my glasses from time to time-depending on how I am breathing. Overall, I am pleased and happy I went with these. I hope this review helps.",US,2020-10-11
4,These fit a man very well,"Half of the masks are a bit on the small size and these are not !

The only issue with them is that there is not adjustment on the elastic strap : (
I over came this problem with a very small trimmed black zip tie for adjustments.",US,2020-12-06
4,Large is too big for young women,"The large size is too big for a ""medium sized"" young woman like myself and falls off easily. The cloth and ear strap material is thin and cheap. The design is comfortable and breathable. I think the price is a bit too high. One of these costing $6 is a bit of a stretch",US,2021-01-12
4,Good mask,"They‚Äôre not too thick for easy of breathing. Not much difference between the extra large and a large size. The small size was too big for my eight-year-old. The medium fit my 11-year-old. I wish they made an extra small size for those extra small faces. Overall good quality. They did shrink slightly in the wash, would recommend hair drying.",US,2020-07-08
4,"Good, just way overpriced","We like the masks. Our 9 year old can wear it with a small tie on the end of each ear strap. I do feel you can get or make the same thing for cheaper these days. The mesh inside is nice, just be sure to wash these constantly, or you may experience an odor",US,2020-09-21
4,"size is off, but otherwise great product","I bought the kids mask (size M) for my 8 year old. It is definitely big on him. I'm just going to tie it and make it tighter for him, but size is definitely off. Otherwise, it's a great mask. Breathable, soft and comfortable for him.",US,2021-01-10
4,Small adult face? Get medium,"Got it because black it goes with everything. I have a thin face (not skinny) but sleek. Fits ok, mask keeps sliding towards my eyes and I have to keep adjusting it. Not good to keep touching your mask to adjust then sanitize your hands again and again. May get medium next time.",US,2020-08-19
4,Not bad for some applications.,"It fits the bill for a reusable mask when you're out for a walk or not in a busy place, which is when these fabric masks are an adequate application. I wouldn't use it if you are in a busy environment expecting to get any real protection.",US,2021-01-29
4,"Lightweight, comfortable reusable mask.","I have been trying various washable, reusable masks. These are lightweight, stretchy & comfortable. They cover nose & chin & stay in place pretty well. They offer different sizes. I hand washed & hung dry. They dry quickly. The only drawback is that without the wire part on the top, it is not as secure a seal & my glasses fog up sometimes.",US,2020-07-18
4,Decent mask for quick trips,Very comfortable for short use. If you need to wear all day your ears will feel sore after a few hours. The fleece side collects moisture if you're exerting yourself so flip it over to the polyester side to keep breathing easy.,US,2020-12-07
4,White ones larger than black ones,"I like how soft these masks are. I have been buying many of these masks so I can add iron on vinyl decals on them. The white large ones I bought were a great size for ""large"". The black ones though said ""large"" but seemed to fit more like a medium. That is why I gave it one less star.",US,2020-11-07
4,It's fine,"seems to be decent quality so far, but a bit over priced for what it is. I had to rush order a few for work, I'm sick of the cheap paper masks. Fabric feels much better than the paper ones. Its fine, and was one of the few fabric ones I could get in under 2 days.",US,2020-07-06
4,Good value,When I bought these I was trying to find a mask that would fit so that I could talk and this mask would still not pull off of my nose. These almost do that. But I had to buy the next size up from what I thought I needed.,US,2020-12-06
4,pretty good,"They are fairly thick and and largely stay on my face, although they tend to slide down down a bit. The price was fair, they do the job, and I look forward to the time when I never have to look at them again! (Hopefully in this lifetime.)",US,2020-08-23
4,A constructive suggestion for mask improvement,These masks are very comfortable but would be greatly improved with a nose wire to mold the mask around the bridge of the nose. In my case my glasses fogged on exhale which I think might be prevented with the nose bridge wire.,US,2020-10-08
4,Moderately easy to breath thu,"I purchased several different cloth mask, this was the easiest one to breath through although not as easy as the paper single use mask. Still offer plenty of protection although air still comes out around the nose, fogging glasses.",US,2020-10-16
4,Great for those who don't wear glasses.,"If I didn't wear glasses, these would be great. Unfortunately, I couldn't wear this for longer than a few seconds because my glasses fogged up so much that I couldn't see at all. My boyfriend loves them though!",US,2020-11-02
4,"Good Masks, not for workouts","Per the caption, while the masks are comfortable, and come in a variety of sizes, the fabric doesn't do well with sweat. It gets extremely difficult to breath into it. However, outside of working out, the fabric is soft and very comfortable. Decent value for money.",US,2020-10-26
4,They actually are XL,I'm a big guy. And you know what they say about big guys and their faces.... Anyway I have a big face and the standard masks barely cover my mouth. These do. And they're relatively comfortable to breath in as well. Yay!,US,2020-09-01
4,Great for those of us with HUGE heads,"Seem to hold up well during laundering too. Only issue: steamy glasses, seems like eventually there'll be a way to form around the bridge of the nose and keep them ""launderable"".

Yup, I just made up a word. :-P",US,2020-07-29
4,Lightweight buts needs nose wire,"If this mask had wire at the nose in order to create a tight fit and a filter pocket, it would be perfect! For me, the fit on my face is the best I‚Äôve found, as it‚Äôs not open on the sides. Very breathable and lightweight. Fabric is soft.",US,2020-06-28
4,Comfortable And Roomy - If They Arrive,"Opened the package and found nothing inside. Every option for replacement requires sending the nonexistant items back. Since I needed masks and these are the only XL sized ones I could find, I took a chance and ordered again. Fortunately the second order did arrive. Not happy about having to pay twice, but the masks are roomier and more comfortable than others I have used. Would buy again when these wear out - hopefully I won't have to order and pay twice again.",US,2020-07-25
4,Quality Face Mask at a Good Price,"The mask is very comfortable to wear. The material is light weight. The only problem I have with the mask is that my glasses sometime fog, because the mask does not fit tightly around the bridge of my nose.",US,2020-10-13
4,Average,"These are average at best, won't last long but get you to do in a pinch.",US,2020-09-08
4,Good Every Day Mask,Bought these for every day use and they work pretty well for that. They are soft and wash/dry easily even when a dryer is not available. These have become my go to every day mask for being outside the home and running errands during COVID.,US,2020-09-19
4,Could be a little more snug,"These masks are well made with a nice comfortable fabric. I am an adult--albeit with a little ""pin head""--but they are not as snug as I would like them to be. I cannot imagine them fitting on a child.",US,2020-07-31
4,stretched after wash,"First, the seller(Mayfair Brands) has excellent customer service and served me well. But the product stretched after several washes which created gaps in the mask. Mask should fit close to face.",US,2020-09-26
4,"Not great for daily wearing, but good for occasional use","A little smaller than expected, and thicker than other masks. The quality is great, but machine washin makes the material pill. I recommend hand washing. The ear loops become uncomfortable after a while.",US,2020-09-30
4,Comfortable masks,"These are well made, very comfortable masks that fit my face perfectly and dont fall off. I would prefer a little thicker but they are soft and bery easy to breathe in.",US,2020-11-06
4,pretty goods masks,they look and feel nice I do wish I ordered a bigger size as the are a bit small but not too big of a problem. only complaint I have is that the strap is made from super cheap bands feels like it will rip easily but hasn't happened yet,US,2020-09-11
4,Slightly overpriced but a really good product.,Great comfort. Can get a little sweaty in warmer climates. XL size fits my face well. Washed them twice so far and still holds well. A little over priced but it does the job well.,US,2020-07-20
4,Worth the money,Nice masks that fit my two year olds face pretty well. The straps are just a little too long so we had to tie a knot on both sides but then they fit great. Will buy more,US,2020-09-19
4,Great mask but not XL,These are really nice masks but I would not call them XL. They are slightly larger than the standard one-size-fits-all. My wife has a small face and she now wears them (and likes them).,US,2020-07-15
4,Nose area,"Really like this product! I would have given it 5 stars if it had a metal nose piece, I have glasses and they steam up with this mask.
Otherwise, very comfortable!",US,2020-10-10
4,No metal strip in the nose,"Love this mask, but have to deduct a star because it doesn't have a little metal strip on the nose so you can conform the mask to fit snuggly around your nose.",US,2020-09-18
4,Good fitting mask. Decent quality.,"Overall, not a bad mask. I am a little disappointed in the size of the material used for the ear loops. Could be a little sturdier. Time will tell about how well they hold up.",US,2020-07-10

4,Fit Well & Comfortable. Contour Around the Face Well.,"I ordered these masks in a size 'S' (3 - 9 yrs old) for my 5 yr old daughter. They fit her really well.
I was a little concerned at first because there isn't a metal adjustable piece in the nose area, but that didn't matter. These masks are contoured just right and the adjustable metal piece isn't even needed.
My daughter is happy that she finally has some masks that fit her well. She's petite, and w/also being a child, it was hard to get the disposable face masks to stay on her well.
I do notice that these masks need to be put on the right way. There is a top and bottom, but it's not as easy to tell. The top is slightly more pointy. I'm going to take some fabric paint and mark near the top, so that my daughter knows which end to put over her nose.
Overall these masks fit well, are comfortable, and my kid can breathe easily.
The only thing is that these fit my 5 yr old really well (w/a little room to grow) and she is petite. She wears size 4T still and can actually still fit in some 3T things as well. I'm not sure how well these would fit an 8 or 9 yr old. I know the range for a size SMALL is listed for 3 - 9 yrs old, but there can be quite a variation in face/head sizes with in that broad range. I would probably go to the next size up if getting these for a 9 yr old.",US,2020-06-27
4,Comfortable face masks and a decent value,"I'm reviewing the 3-pack version of these EnerPlex cloth face masks. I received the large size.

These are fairly comfortable cloth face masks with elastic bands that go behind your ears. The nose area has extra cloth that goes up your nose, but cuts away in swoops so the fabric doesn't go near your eyes. I was able to wear these masks during a whole work day, only taking them off intermittently to eat and drink and I didn't have any issues. You can breathe and talk through the mask relatively easily. The fact that I can breathe through the masks with no trouble is great, but I have no idea how effective that is at stopping airborne viral particles. I have worn cloth masks that are thicker than these and harder to breathe through than these, so I just don't know how effective they are. However, I think they have to be somewhat on par with simple surgical masks. But unlike surgical masks, these cloth masks wash well in a washing machine and being that they are white, you can use some bleach if you really want to sterilize them.

The only have two minor gripes. The first is that while the extra nose fabric works pretty well, I still don't feel like I get a great seal around the sides of my nose. It would really benefit from a thin wire sewn inside to help the top conform to your face and keep particles out. I solved this problem with inexpensive adhesive metal strips that are also for sale on amazon. The other minor gripe is that it's really hard to tell which side is supposed to be inside and which side is supposed to be the outside of the mask based on the stitching. I think I figured it out, but I really have to look at the mask for a couple seconds before I put it on. Some more prominent stitching patterns or a single different thread color would have helped identify the inside versus the outside.

Still, even with the minor gripes I do like these cloth masks and they are now in my weekly rotation of masks I wear to work and wash at the end of the day.",US,2020-06-20
4,Not As Hot As Some Fabric,"I wear a mask at work and have been wearing cotton masks that are really hot. I was excited to give these a try. Compared to what I've been wearing, these are not nearly as hot but I also worry that they aren't filtering as well as the sturdier cotton masks. It's a give and take for sure. The fabric on these is soft and comfortable even if it feels a little thinner than some of the other masks I've tried. I got these in a large and they fit but probably would be too big for somebody with a small face. The ear loops are a comfortable soft elastic which and doesn't bother my ears even after wearing at work all day. However, I'm still happy when I get to take this off.

I love that these come in a package of 3 so that I can keep one at work and one in may car for running errands. For those who work in close contact with others, I would probably recommend a mask with a filter but for running errands and at work on the computer, these masks work great.",US,2020-06-25
4,"One of the More Comfortable Masks That I've tried, but NO metal Nose Piece = Foggy Glasses.","These masks are soft and comfortable. These fit teen/youth and adult faces very well.
I like the ear elastics because they don't rub.
The mask fits great on my face and I really wish I could use them, but there isn't a metal strip on the bridge of the nose and I can't bend it around my nose. This results in my glasses fogging up every time I exhale.
Neither my son or I can wear these because we both have to wear our glasses.
My 16 yr old daughter is using these because she doesn't wear glasses. She loves these way better than her other fabric masks that she had.
The masks wash up really easy. Just toss them in the wash (the manufacturer recommends not using fabric softener) and hang to dry.
Overall these masks are one of the more comfortable that I've worn, unfortunately my glasses fog up w/out a metal nose piece.",US,2020-06-29
4,"My favorite masks that I've used so far, but they still fog up my glasses","Like a lot of us, I've been wearing face masks for about the past three or so months with the pandemic. I've worn disposable masks, cotton masks from work (that don't fit great, and I'm guessing were cheap), some neoprene masks that I bought from Amazon, and now these.

These are my favorite so far. They fit soooo much better than the others do, at least on my face. I ordered these in the medium size, and they fit great. My measurement according to their size chart is 4"", which indicates a medium is the best, and it is for me. They fit on me the way that they look on the people in the video, and they are more contoured to my face than the other masks that I've worn. The ear loops have been comfortable to me, too, but I do have a narrower face that doesn't stretch out ear loops very much.

I'd say that these are about as warm to wear as the disposable ""surgical"" masks, as well as the all-cotton ones that I happen to have (but there are so many designs, it won't apply to all of them). They are significantly cooler than the neoprene ones, and they are less expensive. I paid about $12/each for the neoprene ones, which do have a cotton interior layer, but those things just don't breathe well.

These fog up my glasses like all of the others do. Even the disposable ones with the metal nose piece fog up my glasses, and I find these to be more comfortable to wear.

Honestly, I love these in almost every way. I'd give these five stars if they didn't fog my glasses, and I almost gave them five stars anyway because they fit so well and are so comfortable, but I'm still holding out for finding a mask that's cool to wear and vents somewhere besides into my glasses.",US,2020-07-01
4,Fits XL faces but not XL ears,"I can't wear these for more than 20 minutes. They pull on my ears and hurt too much. I have a size 7 3/8 head and Obama ears. I developed a workaround by looping it over the middle of my ears, but it looks a little weird.

If you have normal sized ears, these would be 5 stars. They are soft, well stitched, water resistant, and filter more than half of my breath from spilling out the sides. They also cover my big face from eyes to the bottom of my chin.

I put them in boiling water and wash with dish soap to get rid of odor. They are also laundry and dryer friendly.

The black size has slightly larger loops that the white size. Larger ears should stick to the black.",US,2020-06-22
4,Works fine,"So...I'm pretty sure this company at one point was making mens underwear, then the pandemic hit and they said, ""Ok...we're making masks now."" These look exactly like mens underwear. I even had a co-worker say, ""uh..is that..?"" No, it's not. Then he laughed. ""Oh! Looked just like a pair of underwear!""

I keep the bag of these in my glove compartment for when I forget to bring a mask with me and need one. Fit is good, these are soft, and breathable, so functionally, I have no problems with these, but as far as looks, I'm not so happy. BUT...they work.",US,2020-06-25
4,"Comfy, soft, breathable - 3 Layers (fabric blends listed in review) - Made in Vietnam","Size XL
Finally a 3 layer mask with a sizing chart. These masks are soft, breathable & as comfy as a mask can be. This fits my hubby who has a short beard. The mask goes far enough up on his nose that his glasses sit on the mask. His bridge of nose to chin measurement is slightly over 5 1/2"" which falls in the upper end of the Large size. I sized up to XL to make sure the mask fit over his beard. He's happy with it.
For another size reference, my measurement is 5""...this mask goes to the top of my nose & covers the bottom half of my face & extends under my chin.

Shell Layer: 100% Polyester DWR
Middle Layer: 65% Polyester 35% Cotton
Inner Layer: 65% Polyester 35% Cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent

Made in Vietnam",US,2020-06-18
4,soft cotton material,"(Youth size) These are made with soft cotton, one of the more comfortable mask I've found on Amazon. That's important to make sure our kids can tolerate it. It's multilayered fabric, so it's thick enough to protect but not too stiff and doesn't suffocate. It's contoured to your face and nose, but it does not have a metal nose piece so it can gap open depending on the shape of your nose. May not be an issue since it's for kids. These are one of the better ones I've tried so far.",US,2020-06-30
4,Ear elastic is long enough to be adjustable with just a simple slip knot if they are a bit too big,"These are soft and fairly comfortable. I chose the size medium listed as for older children and small adults. The last time I order kids sizes they were tiny and way too small for my middle grade schoolers, so I was hopeful with these.

They are too big, but ultimately we simply added slip knots to the nice stretchy, soft ear elastic and they worked great. It has been so hard to find masks for my kids that aren't really little kids, but aren't yet even small adult sized. With the minor adjustments we made these definitely worked.

I think nineteen bucks for 3 masks might be a little high, but ultimately these provided what we needed and the kids like them just fine. So a solid 4 stars and I would recommend them.",US,2020-09-19
4,"Much better fit than my ""Etsy masks"", but has gap on either side of my nose","These masks fit and feel much better than the ""homemade"" masks that I purchased from Etsy. And they are infinitely better than disposable masks. They are very soft and have a great fit. Except for the area on both sides of my nose by my cheek. The mask doesn't sit against my face completely, but it's close. Since the point of these masks is to reduce airborne fluids, they work just fine for that and I am happier with these masks than I was with any of the other ones I have had so far.",US,2020-06-18
4,A good mask,"Things being what they are, I feel like I will be wearing a face cover for the foreseeable future. Not as big a deal for me, but my husband is kind of a big guy with, well, no other way to say it, a big head. He has struggled trying to find a comfortable fit for his face covers. I saw that these were XL, and immediately decided to try them.

So they fit him so much better than a regular one size fits all mask. They aren't enormous or anything, just a little added extra that makes the mask much more comfortable to wear for him. They add about .5"" on either side of center.

I like that they are washable and reusable. I would give these 5 stars if there was an insert for a filter.",US,2020-06-15
4,3 pack of masks,"I like that these masks are white, and made of a cool tech fabric. I wish the masks were cut a little bit lower around the eyes like the black masks made from the same brand. They come in a three pack, so that you can always have an extra while washing them.",US,2020-06-14
4,Comfortable and good fit.,"These are expensive (3 for $18.95), but they are much better than some other masks I've tried, as far as cloth ones. These are sewn so that they give you some space around your mouth and nose for breathing without sucking in the whole mask (I often feel suffocated). Lightweight and the fir is perfect for me--I have a normal sized face, as far as I can tell. These don't sag or fall off. I don't feel like I'm having to adjust the mask constantly. I wear a mask for at least 4 hours a day, sometimes more, at work in a bookstore, so comfort and breathing ability is important to me. These do the job.",US,2020-06-16
4,"No nose ""clip"" so fogs up my glasses","These masks do not have a soft metal band to shape the mask across the nose bridge. The steam from my breathing escapes upward and fogs my glasses. But the masks' polyester blend fabric does not saturate with liquid nor retain stains, so maybe they can be kept cleaner. I especially like the shape: it has a raised part to cover more of the nose when moving the jaw as when talking.

The mask is not tightly flat against the face; it has a small space between the mouth and the mask which contributes to making the mask more comfortable. Maybe on bigger faces, it's tighter?",US,2020-06-16
4,Little big for a 5 year old,"I've been wanting kids face masks for quite sometime. I like that these are breathable and they initially fit well, until my daughter (5 years) started talking. Once she started talking her jaw pulled the face mask down her face. Maybe shes just a little too small for it and with time it will fit her better. Other than the fit not being perfect, I otherwise like the face mask.",US,2020-07-01
4,"soft, works for smaller faces","I got the medium size and fits me and my child, but definitely would not fit my husband. It is very soft and easy to breathe. it does get hot, it is not all cotton. There is no nose wire. The inside is white, outside is blue so they are easy to tell apart. Overall comfortable. They list XL size as 5.5 inches tall, and that would not fit my husband for sure, too. They need to make real XL size masks for sure.",US,2020-07-03
4,Solid Face Masks,"These masks are very solid and great to use during Covid 19. I like to have an extra mask on me at all times, on the off chance they may rip or tear or break otherwise. These are great for use while I work, or go to the store. Very comfortable and easy to clean. I have no terrible issues with breathing while using these. These are a great option should you need a main or spare mask during the pandemic.",US,2020-06-09
4,Nice comfy masks,"These masks are very easy to put on and take off. Previously I was using ones with the elastic that goes all the way around the head, and those were very uncomfortable and difficult to put on, not to mention totally messed up my hair every time. These are much easier especially when you are taking on/off repeatedly, like when out running errands. These I could even wear to the salon!",US,2020-06-05
4,Soft and comfortable.,"Comfortable, washable masks made with 3 layers of soft fabric. The elastic bands around the ears are soft as well. They fit my wife well. There's no metal around the nose. Sometimes they fog up with glasses. It seems like that's unavoidable unless you have an N95 mask with a tight seal. These work well for our family's needs.",US,2020-08-15
4,Soft and comfortable,"The mask is very comfortable, soft and fits snugly. It covers the sides of the face very well avoid any gap for air to reach the mouth and ears. This important feature is missing on most of the masks I got. I feel more secure knowing that the mask covers the face properly. Only downside is that the price is a bit high.",US,2020-08-16
4,Nice mask,"I like the way these feel -very soft, breathable, and the hooks are comfortable on my ears.

These masks stay in place after you put them on, so you aren't constantly having to readjust.

They are a nice cotton, and washable. I wish they had an insert for a filter, but otherwise, they work great.",US,2020-06-15
4,Soft and cover well,"This fits our young teen well. They are comfortable for her going out for a walk. She can breathe easily with it, or as easily as with any mask. The fabric is soft and stretchy.",US,2020-07-29
1,HUGE fit and very thick,The masks are huge! Disappointing to wait for them to arrive and then not be able to use them. I ordered adult size but the masks fits very loose so don't offer the protection required. They are also quite thick. The exterior material is a type of polyester and there is a cotton lining on the inside. It feels a bit like a quilt. The print and colours are nice and are as they appear in the pics but that's the only positive. I learned a good lesson not to buy a mask online.,Canada,2020-12-11
1,Extremely thick,"These are extremely thick and unbreathable. It is not a comfortable mask to wear for any extended period of time. Someone said they are like a quilt, this is true. A thick polyester quilt. Also, $7 charge to return if you aren't satisfied. Definitely not worth the chance.",Canada,2021-02-04
1,Not as discribed or pictured,"What I received was was 2 layered, no 3"" flexible nose clip, adjustable or otherwise and no ear-loop silicone adjuster . The one thing that was right is that it had 2 lanyards. Also fit much smaller . 4.5 ht. x 6.25 width inches.",Canada,2021-01-22
1,"Polyester (not cotton), ugly and smell bad","Even though they say they are cotton masks, the top layer is polyester. This makes your face very hot after only a short time. They smell bad even after a few washes. My biggest issue is that they are very ugly and not like the picture shown. There is very little of the nice paisley pattern - it‚Äôs mostly a strange character - see my picture attached.",Canada,2020-12-20
1,Product is not even remotely as advertised,"Just received these masks and they are nothing like the images above. They are two layers of stretchy fabric with no structural shape (no seam down the middle) and basically suction straight to your mouth. There is no nose wire and they do not stay up. The earstrings are not adjustable, with no toggle present. Only one lanyard was included instead of two. Complete waste of money, do not purchase (see picture for what you will actually receive).",Canada,2021-01-25
1,Not happy at all,"Packaged received opened already , masks seemed to have been taken out and shoved back in, absolutely unsafe and unrealistic to use for safety which defeats the purpose! Not recomending!",Canada,2021-01-02
1,The pattern received doesn‚Äôt match the product picture :(,"I ordered a Bandana Paisley mask color. And as you could see on attached photo - fabric used for bandana maybe the same, but then placement of pattern on the mask makes it look very much different from the advertised picture. And because of this I‚Äôm not happy with this particular purchase.",Canada,2020-12-19
1,Fit not comfortable,"Don't fit my face as I thought it would, uncomfortable and I was not happy with colors...not what I hoped for.
I don't think I will buy masks here again.",Canada,2021-01-17
1,Misleading: do not buy it,ZERO quality and shameful. The product is definitely not the same as advertised. The mask has just one layer instead of three. Do you think those products are the same as advertised? Definitely not! Do not buy it!,Canada,2021-01-27
1,Waste of money,1 lanyard 4unwearable masks belongs in a discount Halloween store where you pay way too much for thin useless garbage.,Canada,2021-01-22
1,Better for kids not men or women.,"I think that the sizing is wrong. Definitely not a men's size as stated. I think this would be great for young teenagers or kids. Too small for me, too tight against my face.",Canada,2021-01-30
1,Did not receive what is described.,"Did not get what was ordered no nose wire, 2 layer, no adjustable ear bands. This was my second order the first arrived as expected this was a cheep substitute emphasis on cheep.",Canada,2021-01-20
1,Didn't like it,"I didn't like the material , really uncomfortable.",Canada,2021-01-29
1,Bad,Bad,Canada,2020-12-24
1,Don‚Äôt fit well,Too large,Canada,2021-01-07
1,Don't buy,"I ordered 4 with designs on them, they were stitched upside down I ordered large and got small",Canada,2020-12-09
1,It doesn‚Äôt fit right,I find it hard to see when I wear it so I no longer wear it.,Canada,2021-01-15
1,These are small masks. Good for a child,These are not large masks. They either cover my most or my chin but not both at the same time.,Canada,2021-01-14
1,Comfortable and great fit,"This mask fit me well. Comfortable, good thickness and glad I purchased them.",Canada,2021-01-22
1,Awful!!,"These masks are pretty, very soft, seem well made, and they fit nicely. As masks go, they are pretty thick. When they arrived they had a very strong chemical odor, so I soaked them in laundry detergent and rinsed them repeatedly. That drastically reduced the odor. The first (and last) time I wore one was for 30 minutes at the grocery store. My glasses fogged so badly, despite repeated attempts to adjust the nose wire, that I eventually had to remove my glasses and do my shopping by braille. They do not breathe at all and they hold the heat in so my face was burning up. When I finally got out of the store, I ripped the mask off and my face was literally wet. Not damp, wet. I bought these masks because they had great reviews, but if you read the 1-star reviews, in my opinion, that is closer to what you should expect.",US,2021-01-15
1,Not a cloth mask,These masks are 60% polyester that's hard to breath out of. This product isn't what it's described as.,US,2020-12-13
1,Read the label,Per the label included with the masks they are only 20% cotton. In addition they had an odd odor and were too small. I returned them.,US,2020-12-01
1,"Nice masks, but they may or may not have lanyards. Amazon no longer selling them.","I got three packs of the masks and ordered these expressly because they had lanyards. The first package had all 4 lanyards, the 2nd had no lanyards,and the replacement for the second package had 2 lanyards, not 4. Amazon said keep them all. They refunded 1 pack, so I only paid for the pack that had 4 lanyards. Amazon said they are taking the product off the site and will no longer sell them.",US,2020-12-16
1,Not breathable,These are way too thick to be breathable. The nose bridge is nice and these masks would be great if they were made with thinner material. Waste of money,US,2020-12-22
1,Not worth it!,"These came in a different print than I thought I ordered. And they smell awful! Appear to be cheaply made, very thin, can‚Äôt imagine they will hold up after 1 wash... going back.",US,2020-12-15
1,Do not recommend,Honestly probably going to throw these away. They do not fit to your face at all. There is no point of wearing a mask that isn‚Äôt snug to your face. The material is also awful. Super thick hot cotton. Not breathable . It looks so terrible on your face because of its odd shape.,US,2021-01-11
1,I don't like this masks,"I don't like the mask ,it has a certain odor
Even if I wash them",US,2020-11-16
1,Terrible product,These are the worst masks I‚Äôve ever bought. They shrunk the first time they were washed. They are so hot to wear and you can barely breath. I would never buy these again. If I could have I‚Äôd given these 0 stars,US,2020-11-07
1,Not suitable for coronovirus avoidance. Item returned.,"Unfortunately these masks are not suitable for use in avoiding coronovirus infection. The weave of the fabric is too loose, with a large number of holes visible when examined in front of a light source.",US,2021-01-08
1,Not all cotton,"The inside lining is cotton but not 100%. It is very uncomfortable and felt like my face was damp while wearing it. If I had known if wasn't 100% cotton, I would not have bought it.",US,2020-12-05
1,Instant return,Cheap stitching and horrible smell,US,2021-01-10
1,Horrible!!!! Bad Quality Control,The metal nose band is not centered on the mask. Makes it very uncomfortable. Also the darts seem to be sewn off center but in the other direction. I won‚Äôt be able to review the wearability of these during my daughter‚Äôs volleyball training bc they aren‚Äôt going to be used.,US,2021-01-14
1,Misleading,These were advertised as anti fog for your glasses. There is no wire bar or apparatus in the nose bridge so glasses completely fog. In addition they are heavy and quilt-like....suffocating.,US,2020-12-02
1,Missing Items,"The masks are very well made however the order did not include the black strings shown in the picture , which was the main reason this product was chosen. What can I do?",US,2020-11-10
1,Not worth it,"No one mentioned those masks are all size and fit different , only one of them fit my gace aaaand it was crooked , baaaad buy",US,2020-12-04
1,Not as described,This was supposed to include 2 lanyards but it did not.,US,2021-01-17
1,Thick and hot,Really hot. Not very breathable material,US,2021-01-14
1,Smell Terrible,These masks smelled like plastic and were not comfortable.,US,2021-01-26
1,Not as described,The lanyard was not included. There is no way to insert a filter.,US,2020-10-27
1,Size,These masks are too big for smaller faces. Very cute though!,US,2020-10-28
1,Not all I paid for,It was supposed to come with the lanyard and did not have it included.,US,2020-11-23
1,Not usable as intended,The clips were made of cheap material. The clips were packaged broken and one clip was missing. I cannot use the lanyard for the intended purpose of easy use of my face masks.,US,2021-02-05
1,Incomplete Order,My product arrived without the lanyards.,US,2020-11-13
1,Straps break,"Received mask today & I really like the way they look. However, I tried on 2 and the strap broke. Returning",US,2021-01-21
1,Did not like product,Don‚Äôt like the way it is made,US,2020-10-05
1,not a good product,Straps popped with a light tug. I dont suggest this item,US,2020-11-18
1,Great purchase!! Great price,Light weight and soft!,US,2020-12-18
1,Not quality made,I wore these for less than a month and the stitching is already ripping.,US,2021-01-18
1,Shrinkage,The first time I washed them they shrunk to the size for a child.,US,2021-01-10
1,No good,No really,US,2021-01-15
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money,Super cheap and unwearable. The metal piece over the nose isn‚Äôt even the center and digs into the side of your face. Don‚Äôt waste your money.,US,2020-10-04
1,NOT 100% COTTON!,"These are NOT 100% Cotton, but LINED WITH POLYESTER! Who wants polyester up against their skin for hours on end? I sent them right back!",US,2020-10-08
1,If you are older than about 5 or a very small adult these might work.,"PRO: The nose piece works very well.

CON: They are very hot!
With the nose piece properly adjusted, the mask will barely cover the lower lip of the average adult!

These masks were designed for children or a population of adults much smaller than the average American. Waste of money.",US,2020-12-01
1,Nose clip hurt and wasn't adjustable,"I bought these for the bandana design, because it looked cool. I wear glasses, so I need face masks with a nose clip. These were the first ones I have purchased where the nose clip actively hurt me. It felt like a sharp stone was cutting into my cartilage while I was wearing it. I tried bending it and adjusting the fit, but it felt like something was slowly stabbing or cutting into my face. Do not recommend to anyone who wears glasses.",US,2020-11-09
1,ok until washed,"these were fine until washed (as directed). The cotton inner liner got really small, so the mask is unusable. Too bad, they were very comfortable when tried on prior to washing (yes, by hand).",US,2020-11-07
2,Not 3D Shape,"Received items don't have a seam in the centre and therefore don't have a 3D shape. They have a chemical odor (possibly from the plastic sleeve they are individually packaged in) and feel like synthetic fabric, not cotton.",Canada,2021-01-19
2,"2 of the 4 masks are smaller, odd shaped and don't fit a man's face.","The two white face masks are smaller than the two black face masks. They are odd shaped and don't fit a man's face.
The two black face masks barely fit a man's face but acceptable for short time wearing. Disappointed. Item arrived on time as promised.",Canada,2020-11-30
2,Very large,"The nose wire is not comfortable. The masks themselves are quite large- too large to be adjusted to my face. I will have to either take them in down the middle, or give them away. Otherwise, the fabric seems nice.",Canada,2020-11-27
2,Too thick,"The image on these face masks are definately better than I expected. Yet the mask itself is like having a quilted blanket on your face. These masks are very thick, I couldn't wear mine longer than 1 hour, never mind all day.",Canada,2021-02-03
2,Not satisfied,"Too loose around chin area. Non breathable material, nose piece doesn't seal so glasses get
Foggy & nose pocket sticks out too far (very ugly).",Canada,2020-11-05
2,Ear pieces need to be reinforced,Ear pieces not attached properly will fall apart,Canada,2020-12-18
2,Did not perform as advertised,No help in preventing fogged up glasses,Canada,2021-02-04
2,Not safe for COVID,"I bought these masks because it states that they have three layers. They are cute and definitely comfortable for myself, an average woman and my 10 year old daughter who is between a kids and adult mask size. The biggest problem, hold them up to the light. You can see every stitch in all three layers. They do not pass the light test by any means and there is no way to add a filter. The lanyard is nice, but these simply are not safe.",US,2020-12-22
2,Meh - not thick enough.,"These are okay - not as thick as I‚Äôd like. They definitely would be better with a filter pocket. As they are, you can definitely feel your breath through the layers. Not ideal for wearing during long shopping trips but they‚Äôd be fine for running into stores to do a quick pick up with minimal people interaction. they are cute, though (except that blue heart one lol)",US,2020-12-04
2,Very hot,These masks are beautiful and I love the design. However we had to return them because they are insanely hot. We have a few other brands that are much more comfortable to breathe in. I really wanted to like these because they are really pretty.,US,2020-11-16
2,TOO LARGE FOR MY FACE,"The mask is very attractive, however I have a small face and this mask is way too large for
my face, therefore very uncomfortable",US,2020-12-10
2,Outside layer is polyester not cotton,"Masks cover well & nose wire is very helpful; many don't offer that perk. However, I was looking for 100% cotton masks as anything polyester causes my skin to sweat & blocks breathability. Two layers are cotton, the outside one is polyester. I can't wear extended period of time due to lack of breathability...I have to wear them for hours at a time. Disappointing, but for those without my quirks, they're a good fit.",US,2020-12-15
2,Way too big for my average sized face.,"These were pretty and soft. The earloops were comfortable and easy to adjust. However, they were very big for my face. The top edge went too close to my eyes. They will have to go back. They almost seemed to fit better upside down.",US,2021-02-02
2,Snout,These are thick and are a little hard to breathe from. The design also makes it seem like you have a snout. They stick out pretty far. The colors are not very vibrant.,US,2020-12-02
2,Thin mask,Thought it had 3 layers and was thicker due to layers but it‚Äôs a really thin mask. It does not have 3 layers of protection,US,2020-11-03
2,Quality not there,"These masks are comfortable but they don't hold up. I washed this one time in a linen bag on delicate and it's falling apart. Based on that, I would not purchase again",US,2020-12-19
2,Not for me,"These were bulky on me, in the middle, didn't care for them, I gave them away to others",US,2021-01-16
2,Sending me a replacement at my expense after I am already returning because the fit is not right.,"I returned the item because the.fitnis off, very pointy at the nose...then they charged my card again sending me a replacement???? Now I have to pay to have it shipped back..very unprofessional.",US,2020-11-25
2,junk,"poor quality , poor stitching junk!!!",US,2020-12-08
2,Great fabric but not well constructed,They are really cool looking but are already falling apart.,US,2021-01-02
2,The fit is way off,"The top of the mask is cut straight across instead of curved and they added a weird dart where the tip of your nose is supposed to be. These two things combined means if I wear these masks correctly, they cover my eyes! Lol total failure, but was a good laugh.",US,2020-12-10
2,Landyards arrived broken,Unfortunately had to give 2 stars because I order 2 sets and all the landyards came broken. The masks were good. Seem a little small. But still work. I ordered these because of the landyards. So sad and very poorly made (landyards),US,2021-01-13
2,Mask,Disliked them. Unhappy with them,US,2020-12-15
2,Way too thick!,"I‚Äôm a teacher and I teach in person so I was hoping to wear these masks all day, but they are way too thick!",US,2020-12-15
2,Ripped after second wear.,"These are very cute and comfortable. I like the snug, flexible fit around the nose. The adjustable ear loops are handy and comfortable. However, the seam split after the second time I wore it. I will sew it myself, but I won‚Äôt order from this company again.",US,2020-11-09
3,Fits big but nice nose clip,"It's pretty of but the come in different sizes... I'd consider not to buy if you are a petit women. Since this masks are already big for a regular size person.
Really odd but some masks are more breathable than others. Nice nose clip keeps the mask on its place
I wear glasses and fog is a really annoying problem. One of the masks
Luckily works fine.",Canada,2021-02-01
3,face masks,Masks have padding that makes breathing difficult. Found I got very dizzy wearing them. Prefer masks that are just one layer of fabric with no padding. Not the most effective but much more comfortable,Canada,2020-11-14
3,h√©las incomplet,"manquais un masque et les attaches
jai d√©cider de garder jaime les couleurs et leur confort",Canada,2021-02-05
3,"Decent masks, not sure laynard are worth it",Masks are comfortable but one of the laynard is chewed up and not usable.,Canada,2021-01-26
3,Not for me.,To warm to wear for long periods of time. Only keep in my car as a backup.,Canada,2020-12-30
3,I can't wear the mask at workplace,The size is good. But it is difficult to breathe.,Canada,2021-01-09
3,Masks okay. Lanyards came broken.,"Masks fit alright and they feel soft and thick
Reason for 4 stars is both my lanyards came broken.",Canada,2020-12-05
3,Mal cousus,Beau tissu mais les coutures sont mal faites. Dommage,Canada,2021-01-03
3,See above.,For some reason l thought it had an opening for a filter. These don‚Äôt however they were comfortable to wear.,Canada,2021-01-18
3,Fits small.,These masks fit small. I‚Äôm an adult female and they are small on me. They would not fit correctly on a man.,Canada,2021-02-03
3,Don‚Äôt fit after there are washed,"The fit ok till you wash then
Even in cold water they shrink",Canada,2020-11-29
3,weird nose,the shape is weird,Canada,2021-02-03
3,Missing parts,"Missing ear loops
Masks are very comfortable",Canada,2020-11-06
3,"Easy to fit, nice design but glasses are still fogging",Easy to fit and nice design but spectacles are becoming foggy,Canada,2021-01-23
3,Lanyards,I found the lanyards too short for an adult.,Canada,2021-01-18
3,nice but just a off a bit,"the metal piece for the nose is off center, the material is ok. the mask is for the most part comfortable but that nose piece inside is off center and lays across the upper cheek on one side. One of the masks was missing the ear piece as soon as i opened the package. over all just okay",US,2020-11-14
3,Did not receive lanyards.,"I really like the masks since they are roomy and easy to tighten over the nose. However, I did not receive the two lanyards, which was a big factor in choosing these masks over others. I tend to set my mask down when outside, in order to help my toddlers. Letting my mask dangle from a lanyard rather than rest in the grass was an appealing concept.",US,2020-10-07
3,Not safe enough,"The mask are comfortable but they are not 3 layers as advertised. I could blow out a match so the thickness is not safe enough for met. When wearing these I should not be able to blow out a match, that tells me the virus could get through the mask and I could breath it out of the mask. Would not recommend these or buy them again.",US,2020-12-15
3,Not really Adult L/XL size?,"Bought these because I need larger sized mask, The elastic is fine, the loop things are fine but the actual mask size seems small. Maybe It's L/XL in China which is where it's made. It's also much warmer than my normal wear N95 mask but that's probably because it's layered cloth.",US,2021-01-08
3,NOT made in the USA,"I searched for face masks strictly Made in the USA. There were several to choose from so I ordered these again, thinking they are Made in the USA.When I received these masks there was a slip in the package written mostly in Chinese with the note saying made in China. Isn't that where Covid-19 came from and why we are now required to wear masks?",US,2021-02-04
3,Meh,"Pros: Coverage is good; warmer than the paper surgical masks; adjustable.
Cons: Does no more to stop glasses fogging up than the paper surgical masks with a metal insert for across bridge of nose; muffles voice (friend told me it was difficult to understand me).

Not horrible but not 'all that'. Would return if possible.",US,2021-01-18
3,Ok,"The mask attachment string is nice.
The mask are a little on the small sz.
Was ok for me and my daughter but kinda small and tight on my husband. The material is decent but they set close to the face so for me I felt I couldn't breath in them .",US,2020-12-10
3,To short after washing,"When I first put them on before washing it smelled of Formaldehyde, but fit okay. I washed them in Warm water. They came out smaller and the smell went away, but I kept pulling it over my chin. Not happy will look for a larger size.",US,2020-12-05
3,Lanyard is useless,"I ordered these because of the lanyard, well it is useless. It is so short that when I put the mask on the lanyard chokes me! The mask itself is not bad, thinner than expected but it does fit my face well. Too bad about the lanyards.",US,2021-02-02
3,size is small,"These are truly well made and good looking. Unfortunately they shrank when I washed them. I washed them in cold water and air dried. If you have a small face or want to find cute masks for children, these will work just fine.",US,2020-12-11
3,Too small for adult male,Nice two-layer cotton masks with adjusters on the ear elastic and a couple neck straps with their own adjusters. These masks would be my choice if they were about 20% larger in the vertical dimension.,US,2020-10-28
3,Lanyard buckle broke immediately,I bought these specifically because of the lanyards with a buckle. The buckle broke immediately. These were a gift so I'm not impressed. Other than than the mask was as comfortable as a mask can be I suppose. Would not recommend if you want to use the lanyard.,US,2020-12-27
3,Little small on adult face.,"All in all good for smaller faces. Kids should fit good.
But for me and my wife its to small.
When we talk the bottom lifts up and exposes air to not get filterd. If you talk it still should stay under your chin.",US,2020-12-11
3,Would have been 5stars if not for wire through material,Love the way these fit. The adjustable ear straps the wire over the nose and the chin strip makes for a comfortable and snug fit. My only issue is with the wire over the nose two of the four mask had the wire sticking through the material.,US,2021-01-02
3,Weird fit,"I like the different patterns/colors, but they aren‚Äôt very comfortable. The fit is just kind of... off. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, I don‚Äôt know. But definitely not my favorite mask, I only use it when I can‚Äôt find or need to wash my other masks.",US,2020-11-01
3,Grandes pero funcionales,"Son buenas porque proteger bien ya que tienen varias capas ,pero da mucho calor y son muy grandes",US,2020-11-24
3,Too big for my small face,"Prompt delivery, sealed, clean packaging my problems were that it does not fit my face underneath my chin. there is a lot of space and the mask rendered basically useless for blocking anything out. The accompanying lanyards are very short as well",US,2020-10-12
3,Good price and it fits well,A little heavy and not very breathable. Fits well and washable,US,2020-10-28
3,Nose wire at upside down position,The masks are nice except the nose wires are at upside down positions . I have to fix them by myself.,US,2021-01-24
3,Will not fit all buyers,"The concept is great, the patterns are lovely but it did not fit my face properly.",US,2020-10-30
3,Bien..,"Estan bien, pero es dificil de respirar.",US,2021-01-27
3,Did not get one of each design as advertised,I like the masks but I received 2 of the purple one and none of the white with the multi colored butterflies and pink edges. (That was the one I like the most so I was disappointed with the mistake.,US,2021-01-31
3,Not like other ones,Don't fit right,US,2020-12-26
3,Masks as seller described,They are comfortable,US,2021-01-07
3,They look good,They are pretty heavy and kind of hard to breath.,US,2020-11-23
3,Not comfortable,"Material is good but did not fit well for smaller face, the nose strip is uncomfortable and was hitting my eye area, the ear loops are thin and tend to pull the ears",US,2020-11-28
3,Comfortable but cheap,It's very comfortable but strands of cloth start to come off after the first wash and it would be fine if it was on the outside of the mask. Not a big fan of them touching my mouth the entire day,US,2020-10-21
3,These are huge,These are gigantic and swallow my entire face. Beautiful designs but expect coverage from your bottom eye lashes to your neck.,US,2020-10-21
3,Says one size but fits really snug,I like the beautiful color's. I am not impresses with the size. The mask is really tight and it's kinda hard to breathe in for long periods of time.,US,2020-12-19
3,Showed up ripped!,"Liked the pattern and the colors.

1,"Nice looking, but ill fitting.","These masks are inexpensive, attractive, nicely shaped and seem well made, but there is no nose wire or any adjustability to the ear straps, whickphbsre quite long , so the mask gapes open, sags and constantly slips down. In order to be effective, a mask must be reasonably close fitting, and these are nothing like that, which missed the point entirely, they don‚Äôt offer adequate protection. That is the reason for the 2 star. I knew about the lack of adjustability before ordering but was hopeful they would fit someone in my family properly- we all have different shapes and sizes of face, large to small, but it‚Äôs the same on everyone, the mask gapes or slips , so we have to return them . I gladly would pay more for the same product with adjustable ear elastics that and a nose wire. . A real shame, as the product look great. Note - Edited down to one star after repackaging to return , and noticed 2 of the three masks have sloppy stitching and loose threads.",Canada,2020-10-04
1,Awful do not order,"I believe this is a counterfeit item. I doubt Levis would put their name on such garbage. When I opened the box, the first thing that struck me was the terrible chemical stench coming from the masks. Also these are not ""masks"" they're so poorly designed and constructed it's basically draping a piece of cheap, chemical smelling fabric over your face with large pockets and gaping fabric so it offers absolutely zero protection. Please do not waste your time or money or compromise your safety in ordering these. They have a no refund policy too.",Canada,2020-11-09
1,NON REFUNDABLE AND SUPER TRASH üóë,These suck they fit weird no matter witch way you wear it if you wear glasses your going to fog them up i don't know what filter the designed this for but its not the PM 2.5 that they sell at every store in Ontario Canada you'd need to put 3 or 4 filters in to have them not move around and cover the nose and mouth if this is genuine Levi's they should probably fix this before lee and wrangler join forces and make a actual denim mask,Canada,2020-11-09
1,Quality control not good,"The masks seem to have an issue with quality control. The straps on the ears were different sizes from one ear to the other so the mask doesnt sit properly. The masks were not a uniform size, only one of the three fit properly. The material was light and breathable, and does have a pocket for a filter. One of the masks was also missing the Levi's logo.",Canada,2020-10-06
1,elastic band is gross and uncomfortable,"such an amazing looking mask and a great big white elastic band similar to an old pair of underwear, is attached, totally uncomfortable, it puts so much pressure on the ears you look like dumbo the elephant.. put a smaller elastic, and make it adjustable just like many other mask makers.. get with the times, we have to wear these MASKS for so long, they should and need to be comfortable. totally unacceptable, that i have to go and get a thinner elastic installed on my own.. plus your sizing is a joke..",Canada,2021-02-01
1,"sloppy, poor quality","this purchase was a package of 3 ""identical"" masks. well.... each gif them look very different in shape and size. they are poorly sawn , completely crooked -- as if it was a project in a High School project....
All seems are very carelessly sawn and the ear loops are way too long to hold mask in place.
Waste of money-- do not buy!",Canada,2020-09-21
1,Do not buy. Very poor quality.,I received the product already falling apart. Without even wearing it. There are loose ends and threads coming out all over the place in this thing. And the loops don't even properly line up with your ears.,Canada,2020-11-22
1,Not worth it,"Can I give it a zero stars, if possible? Worst quality masks ever. It‚Äôs basically a cotton pillow cover stitched with uncomfortable elastic bands. Just got it delivered and looks like the mask was already torn before packing, exactly at the nose level, worst thing you can expect to happen to a mask. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this. $18 is too much for this cheap quality masks.",Canada,2020-09-25
1,The size is not accurate,"I don't know if they sent me the wrong size or if there is a lot of variance. They say the mask is 6.5"" tall in the description but they are a little more than 5.25"" tall. Some people complained their mask is too large and others have complained it is too small. There must be a lot of issues with size.

These masks cannot be returned so accurate sixing is important. I have a larger head and so ordered large masks but now I have wasted my money.",Canada,2020-11-21
1,Don‚Äôt buy,"These are too large,
No way to tighten the ear elastic
The inside fabric doesn‚Äôt fit with the outside fabric, too loose
I washed & dried the masks hoping they would shrink but they didn‚Äôt. I ironed then to try to get the 2 layers of fabric to sit evenly but no such luck.
Disappointed in a ‚ÄúLevi‚Äôs‚Äù brand",Canada,2021-02-03
1,Booo!,These are way too short from nose to chin. They need at least an inch more length. The only way to adjust the width to ears is to tie the elastic which just makes them uncomfortable. And like all masks they are warm af and make your face sweat almost immediately.,Canada,2020-10-30
1,Not 3 large masks.. 3 different sized masks üëé,"I liked the look of them but instead of getting three large masks I got three different sized masks... Only one is big enough...

1,complaint,I received this mask and its way to big. Never even use it. Can not return it for smaller size. It does not clearly say on this item that you can not return it when making the purchased. Very disappointed. so be careful about your sizing before ordering this item.,Canada,2020-10-26
1,Wrong measurements for mask size!,"Measurements are wrong. They claim 7.25"" height. The masks I got aren't even 5.5"". I bought these specifically because they were ""larger"" than the average mask. What a waste of money.",Canada,2020-08-26

1,Not worth it to bother buying and NO RETURN ALLOWED,"This is ridiculous - this product was way too small, and obviously poorly designed, as it did not go over the chin, or even reach the chin - tried to return it but was advised ""Not eligible for return"". BEWARE - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND DO NOT BUY THIS AS THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT IT FOR RETURN, DESPITE THEIR LISTING NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT (NO RETURN) FOR THE PRODUCT",Canada,2020-12-12
1,Masks are not large (DO NOT BUY),If you are looking for a large comfortable mask for a man with a large face or head do not buy these they will not fit.

1,Don‚Äôt buy. Mine came wrecked too.,"One of my masks came with a hole in it. Pretty unacceptable.

1,Poor quality and construction. Better options abound.,"Levi's hasn't been known for quality in years, but these masks are a new low. Poorly constructed and made from the cheapest possible materials, especially the elastic. White isn't a great choice to begin with, but these masks are basically disposable. Really disappointed in this product, but I am out of masks, so I have to use them until something else arrives. If they weren't a perfect match for what's pictured on Levi's website, I would think they're a knock-off. Obviously, a product rushed out the door with minimal quality control.",US,2020-07-24

1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"The fit and comfort of these masks are perfect. However, the materials used to make these masks are extremely thin and evidence of poor workmanship is apparent in the sewing of seams. This is definitely not what I expected from a tried and true brand like Levi. I suspect these items may have been misfits because Levi is not the seller. PLUS, refunds are not being offered though the product is of poor quality. BUYER BEWARE.",US,2021-01-26
1,NOT made in USA as advertised & I doubt they're genuine LEVI brand,"I bought these because the listing showed by Levi & made in the USA. When I opened the package I immediately thought they looked weird. 2 of the Levi tags looked ok but the 3rd was missing Levi all together. The stitching is horrible... there's also a tag on the inside that says Made in Mexico.

I looked on the actual Levi website.... and their masks have the Levi tag on the plain side, not the print side, which confirms for me that these are knock offs.

I have requested to return & get a refund.",US,2021-01-10
1,Not usable facemasks,Theses are cheaply made and i ordered the large and it does not cover my face. Cannot cover your nose and reach your chin. Stitching is coming out and elastic looks different than the elastic on he levi sight. Wont stay on ears. Thinking the bandana print ones with the ear elastic may be cheap knock offs. The levi label is only on some of them. Very disappointed. And they are not returnable.,US,2020-08-09
1,Fake Fake Fake.,"These ""Levi,s"" were clearly a counterfeit. The red was orange, they used a comma instead of an apostrophe, the large I ordered would not fit a child, there were loose threads they looked like something your friend's mom would make and you would try to wear, but would take off as soon as she wasn't looking. Let the buyer beware",US,2021-01-21
1,GARBAGE. No nose bridge wire. Don‚Äôt buy.,"TERRIBLE. I bought these along with two other manufacturers in same order to compare which would fit & feel best. LACK of nose bridge wire causes glasses to fog up &, more importantly, does not allow good ‚Äòseal‚Äô in nose area; **ANYTHING** in the air WILL get around this ‚Äòmask‚Äô & you *WILL* breath it in. Hard to believe these are a ‚ÄòLEVIS‚Äô product...?",US,2020-08-02
1,Likely a knock off,"You get what you pay for. The Levi tag location, stitch work, fabric - material and the elastic on what was received does NOT match the images on page. This looks like a very cheap knock off.
The stitch work looks very messy and uneven. The material looks like it could be see through if it were single layered. The elastic is a 1/4 flat version (something you would get at the 99cent store) instead of a good round 1/8 elastic thread that you would expect, and causes it to dig into your ears or pull them way forward.
Cheap ... cheap ... cheap ...",US,2020-10-23
1,Do not fit snug against face,"They made the part that goes around the ears out of regular elastic and made the loops really big, so mask does not stay close to the face, but moves around and slips down quite frequently. The cloth mask part is a little big, but if the ear hoops were made out of material that did not stretch, these would probably be great, because the mask material is comfortable and attractive.",US,2020-11-26
1,Meh,"***UPDATED***
Shrunk to barely fit my 10 year old after 1 wash. Total waste.

1,A large does not fit my smaller than normal face - returning,"Ordered these masks in a size Large. They are way too small for my medium sized face.

Says large on the package so not sure what happened. Maybe they mean a kid's large. I should have heeded the other negative reviews that said the same thing.

1,Not very effective design,These are hot garbage... The only way they were stay on your face as if you do not open your mouth or talk. as soon as you do either of those things it will either slip off of your nose or slip off of your mouth. Might work for small women and children.,US,2020-08-08

1,"No such thing as large size, they only have a small size.",Incorrect product description. They say the large size is 7 1/4‚Äù top to bottom and as you can see these clearly are not.

Is there such a thing as reversible socks or reversible underwear?",US,2020-10-05
1,Not for me,These are huge and very thick I felt it was hard to breath in and they were way to large kept falling down and of course you can‚Äôt return them once u have tried one on so make sure you buy the right size,US,2020-09-18
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"These are poorly made. We received 3 and 2 of them were not sewn all the way! There is no nose wire. The ear elastic is flat and uncomfortable. The mask, we ordered large based on previous reviews, was too small and for my husbands nose and mouth, but the ear elastics fit him. The mask fit my face but the ear elastics were huge! We usually were the same size mask in the other brands we ordered, just to compare.",US,2020-09-27
1,too thin no coverage,"I ordered the bandana print, the fabric is way too thin and they are too small...im a small adult and they are too small for even the large...not sure if i should return them, totally disappointed",US,2020-08-10
1,Disappointed & returned,"We bought 2 sets of these masks in Large at the same time. 1 set came in a proper (sealed) package, are the correct size, have the Levi‚Äôs symbol and block light when held up to a light fixture. The other set came in an open ‚Äúbag‚Äù, are much smaller, are missing the Levi‚Äôs simple and allow light to pass through. We returned the set from the other bag. If you read reviews and can‚Äôt make heads or tails of the sizing our experience should held to explain the discrepancy.",US,2020-12-03
1,Not as big as described,"The masks are actually really well made, but if you need a mask that is 6.5 inches tall as the description states then these are not the right masks for you. Very disappointed.",US,2020-08-03
1,"Runs very small, poor quality","The large fits very small, I imagine the adult small would be small for a child.

The seam on the blue one was done poorly and had a bunching of fabric on one aide and not comfortable The red one was more pink and feels like it was sewn inside out. The black one had excess material the hung out the top of the mask. Maybe I got the knockoffs since they came in a unsealed plastic bag with no brand marking.",US,2020-07-26
1,Extremely poor quality,Poorly made. Too small. Ear straps too big. Poor quality material. Looks like sewn by kid just learning how to use machine. Was very disappointed overall. Do not buy.,US,2020-09-05
1,Disappointed,"Bought these for my husband in the large size. All 3 masks were different sizes, only 1 if the 3 was large enough, and it was such an off color red, it is more orange and he won't wear it. They all look different, shaped different and 2 are sewn very crooked. Likely to be my first ever Amazon return.",US,2020-11-21
1,These are not good at all.,"I bought these after they were featured in ""Rolling Stone."" They suck. Adorable, but way too small. I have an average-sized face, but these do not cover much of it.",US,2020-08-06
1,Large size dimensions are inaccurate!,"When the masks arrived I tried them on only to realize they were too small. I thought I had purchased the wrong size but the tag and my order shows that I ordered the large.
Measuring all the masks revealed dimensions of 5.25"" L x 8"" H which is significantly off when compared to the promised 6.5"" L x 9"" W dimensions. I would not recommend this product to individuals with larger heads.",US,2020-08-10
1,slides off your nose,"I am constantly pulling this mask up. It will fit around your chin and come off your nose, I don't have a tiny nose I think I would be considered a normal size. None of my many other masks do this. I would say they may run a bit small although this fits my face but does not stay in place. I bought them and did not use them right away or I would be returning them.",US,2020-09-09
1,Way to large and floppy. Unusable!,These look and feel like someone just slapped some fabric in the sowing machine. They are way to big and very sloppy around the nose area. There is just to much textile used and the elastic bands are ridiculously large. The space to insert a filter is so large and roomy that the filter just drops down inside and looses all effect. It generally looks like you are wearing a hand made sloppy Levi's mask made from underwear...,US,2020-12-03
1,Bad bad quality,"These are very unprofessionaly and horribly made, I don't understand why they put reputable brand name on it.",US,2020-10-03
1,Don't Buy!,"Waste of Money! Fits weird. Doesn't stay on nose and looks disgusting on my face.
Very loose fitting..",US,2021-02-02
1,Way too small- Inaccurate measurement is description.,"I ordered these thinking that I would receive a quality product because of the name brand. Levi's had dropped the ball on these. While they do look nice they are much smaller than they are supposed to be. The quality control is off as they were all cut slightly different, and all were an inch or so smaller than what the listing states.",US,2020-08-05
1,loved the product before it fell apart,Bought the product a couple weeks ago and have worn the mask twice. Upon washing the mask the seams came apart at the earloops. The mask also shrunk a lot despite washing on cold and letting air dry. Really disappointed as this was one of the few masks I have found that fits well and is very comfortable.,US,2020-08-04
1,Cute children size !,"Made for children and small people. Will not fit the average adult male, even in large size. Mask should cover face and nose, this mask is not wide enough, and too short.",US,2020-07-30
1,Not worth the $,"Poorly sewn. No way is this made by Levis. Two of them had blank red tags, the 3rd one said Levi's on the tag.",US,2020-08-08
1,Ear loop is horrible,Horrible ear loop band not a good quality Levi‚Äôs could did better than this,US,2020-12-04
1,Poor Quality,"No nose wire, two ply, lots of gaps and not adjustable ear elastic. These do not feel protective at all. Smell like chemicals. I won't use them but too much hassle to return.",US,2020-08-11
1,Poor quality. Won't recommend it!,I am very disappointed with such lousy quality from Levis to be honest. Do not buy. The masks stretched big after a couple washes. I washed all my masks using handwash cycle and air dry them. These still stretch pretty bad and dropped below my nose when I was at stores.,US,2021-01-03
1,The size does not run small like it says.,"The sizes was small and large that was available for order. It also said sizes run small. I don't like anything tight and impressed into my face. I ordered a large. I tried to twist it to make it fit better, but it was messing the face mask up. It would not stay on my face. I was really sad I ordered something, that I really liked the design and could not wear.",US,2020-09-26
1,Not what i thought LEVI would sell.,"LEVIS, you could have done so much better. No nose bender in the mask,,No way to add a filter,, 2 sizes but the elastic is huge. Fabric wasnt matched and looks like they were made from drops. If you can't make a mask with a LEVIS trusted label the ""best"" maybe you should stick to making jeans and jackets.",US,2020-07-29
1,Shrinkage.,Washed two of the three and one shrank to toddler size.,US,2020-09-07
1,Poor shipping oversight - sent me a mix of right and wrong.,I ordered the largest masks they offer and paid extra. I have a size 7 head. Average. They sent me smaller and tighter masks than any others I own. 1 fit right. The other 2 were way way too small they sent me 2 small even though I paid more for the large. Stay away!,US,2021-01-02
1,Patterns don‚Äôt match on both sides,When you put it on the patterns don‚Äôt match each side and looks funky doesn‚Äôt look right. Very disappointed.,US,2020-08-10
1,Too small,Ordered a large. Got a small. Too small doesn‚Äôt fit my face.,US,2020-08-03
1,cheap elastic,"I thought the material would be like a bandana, it isn't. More importantly, the elastic ear hooks look like they are made with elastic that would be used in making a garment, you know, the kind that is sewn into it and not visible.
This seems like a home ec project.",US,2020-10-16
1,"Stitched wrong, too large","DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!!! The stitching is off around the nose, so the mask fit oddly. No nose bridge.",US,2020-10-24
1,Too small for adults,Large size is to small. No nose guard support.,US,2020-08-07
1,Junk,These are VERY low quality masks and I wont even wear mine. Levi products are absolutely junk since they started outsourcing to other countries. Just another American company that is sacrificing quality to make more profit SO SAD!!! I have only wore 501s since 1979 and now I will no longer be a Levi customer,US,2021-01-18
1,NOT LEVI'S....,"This is NOT a Levi's product. Poorly made, 2 layers of very thin fabric. I bought both sizes and neither size fits on a normal size face. I have about had enough of thinking I am buying from a trusted source (Amazon) and receiving substandard crap. I will rethink renewing my Prime this year.",US,2020-10-19

1,Fake Levi's,"Knock-offs. Fake fakers with the ""Levi,s"" logo. Outside of that the large is a little small and moves off my nose when talking",US,2021-01-29
1,The Large size will only fit petite people or children,"I bought these facemasks because I thought they were cool, coming from Levi's but when I got them, I realized that even they were LARGE, the actual size would only fit to a petite person or a child.",US,2020-08-23
1,Extremely Poorly made,"Poorly sewn, halves don't match, Ear elastic ripped out trying one on after opening the package.

1,Horrible quality!,"Do not buy, do not last up, elastic hurts your ears.",US,2020-11-19

1,Large size is small for adult male,"Fit too small for man. Narrow cut.
The sides are only 2 inches. If elastic earloops are stretched tight, then sides bunch even more. This shortens fabric over chin and nose. Earloops push part of ear down.",US,2021-01-09
1,Poorly constructed,Thought this was sent to me in error and was not what I had ordered. Very flimsy and sloppy stitching inconsistencies. Does not live up to the Levi‚Äôs reputation.,US,2020-08-17
1,Very poorly made especially with the Levi's label,"Poorly constructed, ill fitting and completely worthless as a mask staying in position. I was very disappointed",US,2020-10-31

Excellent customer service, but inaccurate sizing. Definitely would not purchase again.",US,2020-09-10
1,Not so great,They were too small and the elastic is too wide to fit comfortably behind your ears,US,2020-10-16
1,These do not protect,I understand that these are not medical face masks but the quality and protection could be a lot better. I made some at home instead and they provide more protection than these face masks.,US,2021-02-04

1,No bueno,No good ..,US,2021-02-02
1,Not worth the money,Poor quality. Very thin.,US,2020-08-12
2,More cons than pros,"Pros:
- Low-cost
- Decently stitched
- Has a filter pocket

Cons:
- Fabric is very thin and isn't of a high-enough thread count (it feels like the same material used for cheap bandanas, possibly a cotton-poly blend)
- The elastic loops for the ears are really wide and don't sit behind the ears comfortably
- The patterning of the mask doesn't conform well around your face

In addition, due to the fabric being so thin, the mask starts pulling into your nostrils and mouth while breathing once the moisture from your breath starts to dampen it, making breathing uncomfortable. I unfortunately couldn't return this due to story policy, and as much as I would rather recommend a reusable product, you are better off buying a standard three-layer medically-safe disposable face mask than this.",Canada,2020-12-02
2,Very small (size L) and poorly shaped. Fit better upside down.,Not sure how these passed QC. I have an average sized head and face. Most masks work just fine for me. These are the one exception. They are way to small for me. I have to choose weather I want to cover my nose or chin. You can not talk or chew gum while wearing these masks or they will come down off your nose. You can tell by the angle that the elastic straps are at when worn as intended that there needs to be some more thought put into these. When you flip the mask upside down the straps are at the proper angle but the tapered nose does not fit the chin so well. Waste of money. Had high hopes for these. Obviously you can't return them.,Canada,2020-10-27
2,No consistency in sizing,"I order Ed one set of these masks, despite reading reviews that commented on the sizes not being correct.

I received a set that were exactly as advertised and I liked the look of them so, thinking that Levi‚Äôs must have solved the problem, I ordered a second set. They were labeled as large but were significantly smaller than the first set and therefore useless to me.

Quality wise they are ok. The fabric is not a tight weave which makes them easier to breathe through but is not great for its desired purpose. It does have a filter pocket though so adding an extra layer fixes that if so desired.

The fit is very good.

They received 2 stars form me for value as 50% of what I received are useless and are not returnable, for obvious reasons.",Canada,2020-11-11
2,Great for people with beaks,"The design and fit of the mask is so odd it left a lot of room in front of my nose. It looks like a mask for birds.
The material is also very thin and didn‚Äôt feel like it offers a lot of protection. Yes it‚Äôs cheap but you really get what you are paying for. I would not recommend this to anyone.",Canada,2021-02-01
2,What I ordered vs what I got,I ordered the large. These are not large. Will be used by my kids. I'm still looking for a larger mask. Sigh.....,Canada,2020-10-01
2,Supersize my face!,"Fits great if you have a snout. These masks are not Levi's quality. I ordered a size small, but received a large. The mid section of the mask is so big you could hide a apple in it lol. I was hoping to like these face masks, but a little fine-tuning is needed needed.",Canada,2020-10-19
2,Caution on these - very small,I would not buy these again. The actual face mask is very small = almost child size. The elastic was huge which would be easy to fix BUT the whole point of buying a ready made mask is to be able to take it out of the package and put it on. I would recommend that the manufacturer put a small toggle on the elastic to make it easier to adjust the size.,Canada,2020-09-27
2,Kind of flimsy,"The logo looks off, and the bag doesn‚Äôt carry any Levi‚Äôs branding. The masks are kind of small, thin. I can barely fit the filter in. I am OK with the cost to unit ratio, but the size and thickness and branding seems just off and not right",Canada,2020-11-07
2,Waste of money,Terrible quality. Ordered large and got 3 different sizes. They pull in my ears. Pulling them down and curling them over. The fabric itself is nice. With improved ear loops I would grab these again otherwise save your money. Buy weddingstar brand they're very nice quality,Canada,2020-12-23
2,Nice design but the elastic is too slack for me,I think the only problem with these masks are how Levi's present them on amazon. Why are they talk about the S size in the description if they don't sell it and just ship L size. Very disappointing... I got to craft myself an adjustment to tighten the elastics.,Canada,2020-10-19
2,not recommended,"When you are breathing ,inside layer sucking inside and touch your mouth, is look like you are breathing inside a plastic bag, I have Asma,make me choking. if you need to wear a mask for more than 15 min not recommended.",Canada,2020-12-21
2,I like that it is cotton but way to big for my face.,"I have bought 2 sets of masks before from other sellers and both of them failed to satisfy me. It's eaither they are not cotton or toooo BIG on my face. Now this one is a cotton which I really like and want to have for a face mask. However, it's again way to big for my face. I hope they can place a adjustable ear strap. or they have choices for size. But my husband is happy to have this for him to use. Thank you!",Canada,2020-11-30
2,Bad.,"Took it down to two stars after trying out for longer.

Stitching looks kinda sus but I do like the bandana aesthetic. The price isn't bad, so I decided to try this out. The elastic bands are uneven so I tried tightening it with an ear saver and it got quite hard to breathe. The face mask fabric material is irritating.",Canada,2021-01-13
2,There's better quality out there.,"Bought these for my husband to wear at work, and when inspecting them before wear, the stitching started falling apart. As a Levi's branded product, I expected better quality. Fabric is very thin, hardly any reinforcement on the stitching. Of course, no option to return. If you want something that will hold up to wear, find something else. What a waste of money.",Canada,2020-10-15
2,Wrong size,"I ordered 3 Large and they sent me 1 small, 1 medium and 1 large so theres only one who fits for me its the large one the other has to go to the trash .... Annoying",Canada,2020-10-12
2,Too small,Perhaps these were made for children but for adults they are way to small. Disappionted with the purchase and they cannot be returned so i gave them to the kids next door.,Canada,2020-11-13
2,Not Levi quality. Very misleading,"These masks are made for monsters. The recommendation for adults was a large... But both adults in our house can't keep these on their face. If you have an average to small face, do not buy the large masks.

They also are horrible quality. I love Levi ... But this is not the qualityyou expect from them at all. Just terrible.",Canada,2020-09-27
2,"Poor fit, poor design, poor sizing recommendations","Spent the morning with needle and thread trying to alter these so a) there isn‚Äôt a long pointed beak shape and b) the elastic far too loose and c) they are a very small fit contrary to the description!!! (Except for ear elastic which is very big)
So disappointed.",Canada,2020-10-05
2,Large is very loose fitting,"Seems to be an issue with the straps not the mask itself idk, i guess I could pin or sew it down, but I shouldn't have to do that, not impressed. I ordered a large because the description and reviews said a small is very tight.",Canada,2020-12-09
2,No the best,"The elastic is too wide, it doesn't fit behind my ears well, and i bought the large which was recommended for most and was huge!",Canada,2020-12-08
2,Scrap masks,They have great colors but the masks are of very cheap quality. The elastic bands are uncomfortable and dig into the back of the ears. Masks look like they have been made from left over material.,Canada,2020-10-20
2,Don't quite measure up.,"Supposed to measure 7.25"" x 9.25"" It is measuring about 6.5""√ó9.0"". A little annoyed as I like the look and overall quality of these.",Canada,2021-01-22
2,These are HUGE.,"These are huge. There are no rubber adjustment pieces. It continually slid down off of my nose which doesn‚Äôt make it effective in preventing the spread of Covid.
Also, only 2 of the 3 actually say Levi‚Äôs on the red tag. One just says ‚ÄòR‚Äô as it‚Äôs trademark.",Canada,2020-11-22
2,Meh,"Too small, barely covers tip of nose and constantly slips off, 1 in pk was noticeably smaller than other 2. Elastic straps dig into ears sharply, and due to small nose fitting it fogs up my glasses when driving cab. Ok for short wears but not the ""large adult"" size described.",Canada,2020-10-07
2,"Lovely Look, But Too Big","Hi, you know those people you see with masks on that fall down and they have to keep pulling them up? That was me. They are pretty and lovely, and if the elastics were a bit shorter I would love them. Or if you have a larger face you could wear them maybe.",Canada,2020-12-11
2,Don‚Äôt buy them.,After a week of using one it‚Äôs already breaking. Siems are coming loose. I‚Äôm surprised Levi‚Äôs would put there brand on these.,Canada,2020-12-15
2,Size,The size is too small and the straps are too short. If the straps are adjustable that will have compensate for the size covering. I bought the adult size for myself but gave it to my 10yr son because it fits him much better.,Canada,2020-12-05
2,Hand wash only,They shrink allot when you wash them. They were large mask when I purchased them but after one wash in washing machine they turned to children‚Äôs mask I would recommend hand washing them.,Canada,2020-12-25
2,Not happy,Doesn‚Äôt fit well at all. I ordered a large but that was too small. The straps for the ears are uncomfortable.,Canada,2020-10-21
2,"Breathable, but not comfortable.","The elastics are not very comfortable, and not as pliable as some other masks. Fits a bit on the small side, but still slides around more than others.",Canada,2021-01-20
2,for children,This is definitly a size for children and adults with very small face frames.,Canada,2020-12-06
2,Very loose fit,These fit really loose and are not adjustable,Canada,2020-12-28
2,Would pass on this product,Too thin and have no nose metal piece.,Canada,2020-11-19
2,Not worth your money,Not authentic Levi‚Äôs. Feels and looks really cheap. Bad sewing job. Would not purchase again.,Canada,2020-12-07
2,Not happy with face mask,To small and don‚Äôt even reach my ears properly,Canada,2020-10-28
2,Not as expected,The red one pictured came as orange. The fabric is not as I would expect from a Levi product. The large is very big! Be careful to choose your size well,Canada,2020-11-04
2,Smaller than expected,Product is very small. More suitable for kids or teens.,Canada,2020-10-27
2,Fits very small,These look like good masks but they fit much smaller than they claim. I would say they are an adult medium. Not large and certainly not an extra large.,Canada,2021-01-05
2,Wrong size listed,"Be aware that the size may be wrong. Says Large 6.5"" tall and 9"" long, but received a 5.75"" tall and 8"" long.",Canada,2020-11-29
2,Bad design,Too small. I got a different brand that came with 5 that had a better design for lower cost.,Canada,2020-12-14
2,Not very comfortable,Even after washing still rough in the face,Canada,2020-12-01
2,Not what I expected from Levi's.,Doesn't fit well. Pulls my ears forward and the straps for around your ears are thick...like a stiff shoe string. Better masks out there for sure.,Canada,2020-11-07
2,Livid masks,Fits a little too loosely,Canada,2020-12-01
2,Meh ...,"Look nice but don‚Äôt wash that well, could use something over the bridge of your nose to help it fit better.",Canada,2020-10-04
2,"Minimal protection, only two cloth layers.","Small mask, provides minimal protection.",Canada,2021-01-29
2,Cheap junk,"Thin. Not worth the money to be fashionable. Definitely won't stop a sneeze or cough getting through. Poor, loose fit.",Canada,2020-10-22
2,To big,Way to big thought I ordered small but came as large. Does not fit so I can‚Äôt even use them.,Canada,2020-12-15
2,Not what I expected,I did not like the fit or workmanship of these masks,Canada,2021-01-10
2,"more of a women's fit, elastic was thick and uncomfortable","Very small mask, did not fit my teenage son",Canada,2020-09-29
2,One of the masks was missing,Other then not sending all three masks they are good. The Caviar coloured one was the one that is missing.,Canada,2020-11-17

2,Large,Very large :( don‚Äôt fit,Canada,2020-10-21

2,Oversized,"Made well-ish, but they‚Äôre absolutely massive!",Canada,2020-10-21
2,Too loose,The mask was loose on my face.,Canada,2021-01-16
2,Too big,Product was too big,Canada,2021-01-11
2,Pretty disappointing,I read the reviews and there were so many mixed opinions that I thought I would give them a try. The bandanna pattern is cute and I like that they are 3 different colors. I figured for the price they were worth trying. Unfortunately they are pretty disappointing and I won‚Äôt be using them. They are very cheaply made. The fabric is really rough and thick. They don‚Äôt fit well. The ear loops don‚Äôt stay on well. I‚Äôm constantly having to adjust to stay on my face correctly. They don‚Äôt stay around my nose and keep dropping down. They are not reversible like the description said. I would not buy them again.,US,2020-11-14
2,Not a snug enough fit.,"Although cute fabric, and soft enough fabric, something about the design is off for me and my guy. The fit is way too loose to be effective at keeping my germs off others or their germs away from me. I may try cutting out the elastic loops and trying it with shoe laces of strings to see if that helps. i expect a mask to fit flush on face. This felt like it was going to fall off at any second. Better go back to the design drawing board Levis...if this is even genuine Levis. So hard to know. I would look elsewhere for a mask.",US,2020-08-17
2,Cute but poorly made,"The masks are cute and the material is very comfortable. They are poorly made. The loops are a thick elastic strap which is uncomfortable. The loops are not symmetrical causing the mask to sit crooked on the face. The loops are also too big for the size of the mask. I purchased draw string stops to adjust the sizing of the loops, but they could also be sewn. For the price, the masks are ok and I will definitely be using them because the material is comfortable and not to hot. But if you don‚Äôt want to spend time or money to alter the straps to fit, I would not recommend these due to the poor quality of the construction.",US,2020-08-13
2,poor sewing quality.,Its very poorly stitched together. I would've expected something a little better quality from levi. They def need work with there quality. The black mask fits a little lose and the others fit just fine. But the seem where the two separate pieces of fabric are sewn together is horrible. It wasn't lined up properly before they stitched it together. So the fabric bunches up in certain spots. Just not what I would've expected from levis. I am a levi nut. I wear levi everything. From shoes to sox to boxers and jackets and shirts. Levi everything. This is def a bad quality product. I will NOT be ordering levi face masks again.,US,2021-01-13
2,Can't Breathe Through It!,"If you can actually breathe through these, more power to you. I like the look, and I might use it to look ""good"" for a 5-minute stint, but they just don't work from a practical standpoint. I took one layer of fabric off to see if breathing through a single layer would be possible, but it is still WAY uncomfortable vs the cheap (albeit less stylish) paper version.",US,2020-10-24
2,very thin,"I ws hoping I was going yo like these masks, but there very thin, if you hold them up to the light you see right through them. So i figured I would buy the filters, which I did, but yes they might block your vapor from going out, and I even doubt that, but anything you breath in will just come in around the filters anyway, so I will not wear them, I dont think there safe",US,2020-09-02
2,Not comfortable,"I bought the large size. These are made with a flat spring band that has a fixed length. In between the lack of adjustability and the uncomfortable flat spring, my ears get bend/ crushed. Actually quite annoying it trying to wear them for longer periods. They are good looking and well made, but the design and dimensions are, in my opinion, faulty. Should they had been made with a round spring band and adjustable loops, these would had been 5 stars",US,2020-11-06
2,"The ""Large"" size is more like Medium","While the amount of face coverage is all right, the ear loops are too tight and pull my ears forward -- very uncomfortable. I am now facing the choice of returning them or replacing the elastic bands. The ear loops on some masks feature adjustable tabs and allow for an extra inch of play. I was disappointed these otherwise nice masks don't fit. (I am big but not ""huge."")",US,2020-10-11
2,Large Size Inaccurate,"The website states the mask is 6.5"" L and 9"" W... as other reviews state, this is completely false. Practical measurements are closer to 4.5""L and 8.5""W -- even if you consider the additional fabric needed to make a pocket for the nose and mouth area, you only get about 5""L and 8.75""W. The website description, at least for the Large size, is completely inaccurate. It only covers the mouth area until you open your mouth to talk. At that point, either the mask slips down off the nose or it slips up above the bottom lip. Perhaps for children or adults with small heads, the large size would fit appropriately, but certainly not for most adults. I'm extremely disappointed because Levi's is a brand name I'd expect to have a superior product, plus the design is exactly what I wanted. These, however, are completely unusable and have been returned.",US,2020-08-18
2,"The elastic is short and cheap, stops the mask from fitting","Adult male, and I ordered a large. Mask seems okay, kind of thin for two layers. But I won't be wearing these because they are too small, specifically the elastic is too short and feels cheap. The elastic stretches to its limit and folds my ears forward.

Give these a pass, find something else.",US,2020-11-28
2,"Cute, but not as expected","These are very cute print - and they have a ""Levi's"" lable on, so I was expecting something really great for $14.00 for 3. Disappointed and wouldn't recommend. They are very cheaply made and thin...and yet they are very hot and hard to breath through. Will still use them for the times I need one on - but will keep looking for better ones.",US,2020-10-25
2,Size large is not large enough.,"1. I purchased size L but the mask is not large enough vertically to stay on both my nose and chin at the same time.
2. Straps are a little too short, pulling my ears forward. They stick out far enough already without additional help.
3. Pretty design, but functionally useless.",US,2021-01-22
2,SIZES ARE INCORRECT. LRG IS VERY SMALL,"I have no issues with the masks as they are made well and have a pocket for the filter, actually made better than most I've tried but I needed one 6.5 inches as the large was described as. It is 4.5 inches (from nose to chin) They are lovely otherwise but when you order be aware that sizing is misrepresented.",US,2020-08-09
2,No nose wire,These masks are so cute but I'm super disappointed that they don't have a nose wire in them. It's my fault for not looking specifically for that wording in the product description but I just kind of assumed that all masks these days come with them. I likely will not use these.,US,2020-09-23
2,Itsy bitsy teenie weenie,"I'll admit I have a big head. I'll admit I didn't really read the reviews, cause a mask is a mask is a mask. I'll admit I washed them, probably in hot water, because they smelled of death when I got them. But these things are TINY. Unusable for me and adult faced people.",US,2020-09-03
2,DON'T BUY: unless you have a really small face.,"I ordered the large sized masks. They are too small. I am 5'4"" of average build. The masks barely reach from nose to chin & the elastics pull my ears. They are not well made. Each is slightly different from the others. I expected a much better quality from Levi.",US,2020-08-11
2,Not Authentic Levi's,"I think these are a knock off .The Levi tag location, stitch work, fabric - material and the elastic on what was received does NOT match the images on page. The stitch work looks very messy and uneven. The material looks the same but that is it. The elastic is a 1/4 flat version (something you would get at the 99cent store) instead of a good round 1/8 elastic thread that you would expect, and causes it to dig into your ears or pull them way forward",US,2021-01-11
2,It looks nice but the fit didn‚Äôt work so well,"The elastic around the ears is very wide and rotates and digs in a little. I thought it was more similar to the clinical blue and white masks‚Äô elastic. The large is also a little small too.
The plus is that the masks‚Äô material is comfortable and looks nice in person though.",US,2020-07-24
2,Large size is not very large,"I got these in large size, but they are still much too small on my face.
The straps are uncomfortable around my ears.
I got a generic one at a local store for 4 bucks that is a good bit larger, and the straps are much more comfortable around my ears.",US,2020-10-19
2,Very small,"Although I love the thin and breathable cotton fabric, these masks are very small. I am a woman with a small face, and the size Large are even too small for me. They would be perfect for a child.",US,2020-09-05
2,Average,"It is a fake Levi's product guys. I don't like it. The rubber is strong. It hurts my ears. I don't want to return it too since it is personal use. Uncomfortable for using for long hours.
But it serves the purpose of covering your nose and mouth.",US,2020-08-10
2,Good Concept,"The masks were pretty and the idea of having them reversible was a great idea. That being said, I did not feel like the masks were uniform in size and the way they were sewn was not great.",US,2020-08-07
2,Improper size advertised.,"I ordered the ""L"" large size for this package of 3.. but clearly they are not all ""L"". Disappointed in the sizes I received. Only the actual large one fits perfectly. The smallest one of the 3 is NOT properly sewn.",US,2020-10-14
2,Ordered 3 size Large in a package,I ordered a package of 3 mask size large. I received 2 large size and 1 small size. These mask shrink a lot when washed so the size small was not usable after shrinkage.,US,2020-08-24
2,to small for an adult,They need to make an extra large for an adult. I'm an average male adult and the large might fit a woman. Just barely covers your nose and slides down when you talk. Very annoying.,US,2020-08-15
2,Bad mask,Great except for 1 thing. There is no nose piece. Just floppy material so when you exhale it blows up your face and fogs your glasses. With the Levi brand I would have expected they would have figure this out.,US,2020-10-29
2,Look & Feel great but very small!,I was happy when I got these as they look and feel great but they don't fit a typical adult at all these are smaller than any other mask that I've tried.,US,2020-08-21
2,"Don‚Äôt waste your money, I wish I could return them !!!","The mask are still made for a woman‚Äôs face don‚Äôt fit my man face after I wash them they shrunk!!!
I just gave them away to the kids",US,2020-10-23
2,The large is to small!,"Nice idea and colors however I put one on and adjusted it uttered six words, and it slid off my nose! lol!
Save your money!",US,2020-08-06
2,Inconsistent fit.,"Two of the masks fit, the third was way too small - inconsistent sizing. The masks feel too thin to be of any real protection, but OK for emergency use.",US,2020-09-28
2,Quality is an issue.,"With a name like Levi's, I expected much better quality. I found them to be poorly made and very thin. We don't even use them because of the quality--we don't believe them to be protective.",US,2020-12-15
2,Smaller than stated,An inch short from nose to chin than stated. I can't use them. If I talk it either pulls off my nose or pulls up to my mouth.,US,2020-12-15
2,Not for large faces.,"Definitely not for large faces. Very tight fit, no filter pouch (if you're looking for that).",US,2020-11-16
2,Not ideal for adults,"Way too small for an adult male, both available sizes are perfect for kinda and teen, I ended up giving them to my nephews.. if you are a medium male adult your are better finding other options.",US,2020-08-02
2,Run big,"I‚Äôm a female adult and the masks were way too big! Nice pattern, but bad fit.",US,2020-10-09
2,Too small,"Way too small of a mask to cover the mouth and nose. Additionally, there was too much elastic to keep the mask in place. I ordered large...it might fit a child or teenager.",US,2020-08-12
2,"Cute for style only, fits poorly",Cute fabric but mask is too small to cover nose and mouth. After washing straps loosen and won't fit at all. Purchased large size,US,2020-10-25
2,Not actual sizes,These are ok for smaller faces but do not bother if you need a larger mask. They lied about the sizes. The large is actually the size of the small.,US,2020-08-07
2,Sort of a waste of money,I think this product is only good enough to qualify you entry in to locations that require it. It‚Äôs extremely thin and see through. Not any sort of protection. The adult size is a fairly good fit. The small was just to small for my 8 year old so buyer beware. Young teens and older kids won‚Äôt be able to fit into either.,US,2020-12-12
2,They are just pretty not safe,They don't fit well on your face you have to keep pulling them over your nose they slide alot,US,2020-08-09
2,Small and cheaply made,"These masks are cheaply made from thin fabric. Light shines through when held up to the light. They‚Äôre also small - way too small for an adult male face. These might fit on a smaller scrunchy-faced person, but given the questionable quality I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these for anyone.",US,2020-08-06
2,Quality not what I Expect from Levi‚Äôs,I had to finish edges on two of the three masks. Trimmed loose threads. Had to permanently knot the loops because the masks were way too big.,US,2020-12-02
2,Too small,"I got the large, but they are too small for my face. I would say I have an average sized man's face. The mask does not adequately cover my mouth and nose at the same time, and comes off if I speak.",US,2020-08-22
2,I think it runs large and I only got 2 instead of 3 masks.,"I only received 2 instead of 3 , red and blue. I ordered the adult size and it‚Äôs big for my face so I‚Äôll have to hand sew the elastic so it is more snug.",US,2020-10-14
2,Little Levi masks,Made for smaller faces or for kids not men.,US,2020-11-10
2,THESE ARE NOT MADE BY LEVI!!!,The vendor is advertising these masks as Levi.. They are homemade bandana masks.....,US,2020-11-01
2,"If you expect Levi‚Äôs quality, do not get these.","They are featured as Levi‚Äôs, being accustomed to such quality, I must say these not only do not look the part and definitely do not feel the part, very cheap construction, disappointed.",US,2020-11-18
2,Child size,They are not very soft and are really small,US,2020-12-27
2,Poorly Made,I wore this mask one time and the seam broke. The large size fits well. But they a very poorly made. Don‚Äôt recommend.,US,2020-10-05
2,Poor quality and sizing. It isn't what I would call reversible.,This mask is too small for my husband and it really isn't reversible. I ordered a large and it seems very small to me. He hates it!,US,2020-08-02
2,Too small,"Cool design, but too small for a larger faces. Not as breathable as most masks.",US,2020-08-24

2,Only got two.,"Only got two masks. If someone from Levi can contact me I will give a higher rating. Great fit and comfort,",US,2020-10-12
2,Returning these - elastic straps too long,"Returning these because the elastic straps are too long and the mask kept slipping off my nose - had to constantly adjust it to keep it over my nose. Very annoying, impractical, and ineffective.",US,2020-08-23
2,Small,Nice But small,US,2020-08-22
2,Never a good fit,"The big size is too big and the small is too small , the large also fits pointy in the nose and then feel tighter in the bottom than the to.. just overall bad for me. I spent $30 on both the large and small sizes and still not happy . Oh well. Just got them because they were Levi‚Äôs.",US,2020-11-21
2,Not consistent,"Only one mask fit. One was too tight, one too loose & one just right. Its a crap shoot IF it fits. I would not purchase again unless sold individually so I could return the two that are not rightüòí",US,2020-10-14
2,Too many tags,"The Levi tag was inside the mask as well as a big white tag, I can't wear anything touching my skin on the inside of the mask. It was roomy and plenty of stretch to the elastic. I was disappointed the Levi tag wasn't on the outside of the mask.",US,2020-08-24
2,Too loose,Recommended size for adults was a L but L is wayyyy to big,US,2021-01-17
2,"Large is 5.5"" from top to bottom.","It is too small for me, but I have a long face. Might fit you fine.",US,2020-07-30
2,Poor at best,Elastic is very lose. All three masks had different measurements.,US,2020-08-04

2,Cheap and uncomfortable,Cheap and uncomfortable,US,2020-12-07
2,Too big,I bought the mask in large but it‚Äôs to big it doesn‚Äôt fit on your face because it‚Äôs to big and loose so it doesn‚Äôt protect at all I think the mask are cute but it just doesn‚Äôt fit right.,US,2020-08-10
2,A large still looks small,I got the large yet it was still small. When you have them on the part that goes around your nose is big I do not have a Pinocchio nose so it felt loose in that spot. Out of the 3 the blue one came poorly made,US,2020-08-14
2,No era lo ke esperaba,Muy fragil la tela,US,2020-12-28
2,Mask,"Didn't fold flat, but ok otherwise.",US,2020-10-06
2,Elastic Straps Way Too Large,"While the cloth material fits fine, the straps are comically large and the mask falls right off my face. Have had to sew the elastic straps to shorten. Would look elsewhere.",US,2020-08-10
2,Levis missed the mark on this one,Not worthy of the Levis tag. Very disappointed with the lack of quality.,US,2020-08-09
2,would not purchase if seen in person at all,"Disappointed in the white elastic ear pieces! Looks tacky and rubs ears, says they are reversible but they only look inside out that way",US,2020-08-06
2,claims it runs small but not really?,I ordered a large because it said they run small but should have gone with the small as they were too big to be useful.,US,2020-10-19

2,No good,Said they were lrg,US,2020-09-05
2,Large is not large,Large will not fit an adult male,US,2020-08-21
3,Not large enough for adults.,"The mask is not quite long enough for an adult face, it would fit a youth or child. It does not have a nose wire to tighten across nose, so is annoying to wear with my glasses and they fog up. The material and style is nice, but overall disappointing for the price. I thought it would be much better given it has the Levi name...luckily I don't go out much so only wear short while. Still searching for a goid mask. This is my third purchase on line..,and it is not THE ONE.",Canada,2020-09-02
3,Look good but fit weird,"Strange fit.
Mask has a pocket for filter but never tried. I feel like I wasted my money it's cute but does not fit well (I can't explain it I keep adjusting the mask when I did wear it - uncomfortable).",Canada,2020-09-24
3,Too big for LG size,"The material seems to be a good one, easy to wash and there is a pocket if you want to add extra filter. For my wife they are way too big. If you have a ""regular"" size face/head do not buy size LG, go with M size. And I'm not talking about the straps, the mask itself it is huge for this size...",Canada,2020-09-25
3,Not horrible,"The ear bands are too thick for myself personally, it folds my ear when fitted. It‚Äôs great material, definitely suggest washing it beforehand as it smells odd. I love the patterns and would otherwise be perfect with different elastics",Canada,2020-11-03
3,Really for large face people,"This isn't just an adult sized mask, it is for people with a large head. I'm just average sized, and it doesn't fit snuggly enough to be of any use. I will have to find a larger person to donate these to.",Canada,2020-11-24
3,"Nice design, air dry & annoying elastics",I don‚Äôt recommend putting them in the dryer. However the masks are pretty thick. The elastics are somewhat annoying if you are wearing this for a long time... but good design and colour options,Canada,2020-11-26
3,Love the fit except for the elastic,Perfect thickness for me and breathable but that elastic hurts my ears and is frankly too wide. You can find better for cheaper...the only thing is that it's a cute design,Canada,2020-10-22
3,These are huge and not easily adjustable,"I have a relatively large head but these masks proved too big. It just droops on the face, would not suggest unless you gots a giant melon or some real chubby cheeks.",Canada,2020-11-03
3,Nice masks but fit large,"I bought the large after reading a review that the large is a better fit. However, I am a woman and find the large is saggy so I have had to knot the elastics on each side to prevent the mask from slipping.",Canada,2021-01-01
3,Decent mask with a filter pocket,"I like the bandana bandit look, though I'd like it better if the patterns were better aligned along the centre stitching providing a more balanced look across the two sides.",Canada,2020-10-26
3,"Nice print, breathable fabric",Not adjustable. Would have added a star on for that. I added that myself. Overall it was a breathable fabric. Nice print. It is a 3 pack so the value is there.,Canada,2020-12-06
3,Needs a nose piece. Pass,"Seems to made of a decent material, good elastics. No nose piece is a bad choice. Slides all over your face. Not as good as it should be",Canada,2020-10-27
3,Lining not super soft,"Ah 2020 life....bought to add to my mask options. Good size, fit well but found the interior cotton lining not super soft. Not my favourites in my pile of masks, but great as backup choices.",Canada,2020-11-10
3,Beaucoup trop grand,Bonne qualit√© et bon prix mais la grandeur est beaucoup trop grande pour moi..Mais les grosses figures cela serais parfait ou homme a grosse barbe,Canada,2020-12-07
3,Nothing special,Didnt look exactly as pictured. I dont believe this is a real Levi's product. They fit my husband well way to big for my face.,Canada,2020-10-05
3,Too big for my tiny head.,"Good quality, but too big.
Not great for smaller adults like myself.
I have a bit of small head, but still too big for kids sized things.
The mask struggle is real.",Canada,2020-10-24
3,Thin and doesn't fit,Thin fabric. Too large for me and my teens. Too small for my husband. Would be helpful to have adjustable ear straps.,Canada,2020-10-07
3,Stylish and crisp looking,"The masks do their job but without a ridge to hold the nose in place, the masks moves around a lot. I still wear it all the time but it would be even better with a metal ridge.",Canada,2020-09-24
3,Ok but smaller than expected. Too tight for me.,"If this is a large I wonder what small is.... definitely not big enough, a bit cheaply made with only ok stitching.",Canada,2020-09-29

3,Who wants wrinkled Levi‚Äôs?,"The reason I bought these mask is because I love my Levi‚Äôs. Unfortunately these mask are very thin and while there is a place to insert a filter, it‚Äôs only on one side so it‚Äôs difficult to get another layer/filter in. Also, not too sure if they should go in the dryer because they‚Äôre so thin and cotton and I don‚Äôt want them to shrink. So they are really wrinkled after air drying. Bottom line‚ÄîI think Levi‚Äôs should make their mask so they don‚Äôt wrinkle because who wants wrinkled Levi‚Äôs.",US,2020-10-07
3,Not for those with big heads...,"As a larger individual, I found that these masks were slightly (too) small to fit me comfortably. They need an XL size selection for those like me, it would seem.

I am unable to give much more of a review on the product as they were an incorrect fit for me and I was unable to use them.

Just in time to pass out as stocking stuffers this season!",US,2020-12-15
3,Not great but cheap,"I was looking for masks online and had several negative experiences with poor quality products. I also wasn't going to pay $20 for a single mask. I saw these at 3 for $15 and since the brand was Levis I figured they would be at least acceptable quality. They arrived on time and were as advertised. They are maybe a bit small, and the material is very rough making them less comfortable to wear than a lot of others. But at the end of the day they are acceptable because they only cost about $5 each.",US,2020-09-04
3,you get what you pay for,"So I needed some neutral (non-holiday) masks for my job. These do not come with a nose wire in case you are wondering. However they are comfortable but way too big. They do have ear loops that stretch, however they are sewn in and not really adjustable. The mask itself is way too big across the face. But again for three masks under $6 they will be sufficient.",US,2021-02-03
3,LARGE size is still TOO SMALL,Still struggling to find a large sized mask that will fit my face and this one is yet another disappointment. Leaves a lot of loose room on sides of nose that just allow air to free flow defeating purpose of the mask. It fits tight on chin but that causes the mask to slip lower and lower and eventually off the nose. Very frustrating from a mask that has had so many positive reviews.,US,2020-10-17
3,Stylish but small,"The pattern is cool but the large size seems to be small for me. They are thick and I can‚Äôt imagine trying to breathe through them if I added a filter. The straps are thick which makes my ears pull down like Gollum. I think you just need a smaller head for these to work. I really wanted to like them.
Great price if they fit you.",US,2020-10-21
3,Appear sizing inconsistent based on reviews and my experience: needs quality control.,"Purchased the larger size based on reviews. Fabric itself is nice and consistent with product photos. Fit is poor, ear loops were stretched and lost their elasticity on one mask. There are gaps at nose and sides. I am an average size adult with a medium frame. My head is not small, I would expect this to be the appropriate size.",US,2020-10-21
3,JUST OK!,These really run on the small size and very thin material. They do have an opening on one end to insert another layer which I think is needed. I would not buy these again and a bit surprised that these were made by Levi. I expected a little better quality from that company.,US,2020-07-24
3,"As Masks Go, Not Terrible",Not thrilled about having to wear a mask but if I have to I figured I'd go with the classic styling of a Levi's bandana rather than one of those space-man looking masks I see advertised on Amazon. I'm an average size guy but these are a bit large - at least pre-wash. The red one reads closer to pink than the deep red I recall from the red Levi's bandana back in the day.,US,2020-08-02
3,These are not good.,"Not real 'Levis'.

They are also smaller than you'd want or at least smaller than most masks seems to be.

They look great but are less functional than any other mask I've purchased to date which is saying something.",US,2020-12-01
3,"Started out okay, but had poor stitching.","I got the large and it was tight around the ears. After one wash the stitching around one of the elastic bands holding it to the cloth is coming undone.

Even though it was tight I still liked them until the stitching came loose.",US,2020-10-06
3,Meh,"I really was looking forward to these masks but after trying them on I was slightly disappointed. With the Levi brand I was expecting a higher quality than what they are. The elastic straps are cheap, hard and uncomfortable.",US,2020-11-15
3,The large is still incredibly small.,"I thought I had a mixup when I got my masks in. They look good, but the straps/size of the actual face covering are very small. I feel this would work out fine as a mask for a child, but no where near sized for an adult.",US,2020-08-06
3,Not the standard Levi's quality!,"You would expect top-notch quality if a product is from Levi's but sadly this feels rushed work. The sewing is not clean. A thread hanging from almost everywhere. And all of this when you're paying $15 for three masks. C'mon Levi's !!!
The pros are cloth feels nice on the face, the masks have a slot to put a mask filter, print is nice, hope it stays the same after regular washing.",US,2020-09-23
3,Small Adult,"I like the patterns but these masks are for small adults. These masks are made of woven fabrics, not stretchy. The elastic ear pieces are too tight. If the elastic was a little longer, I would be happy with them. I will change the elastic on mine so I can continue to wear them.",US,2020-11-15
3,TOO SMALL,"Cute factor 5 stars BUT comfort level 0 . I'm a normal size female and I do wear glasses BUT the straps are wide and uncomfortable on my ears. The fit is small and pulls on the bridge of my nose. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE to wear for any length of time. NO NOSE adjustment, which I knew but still....waste of money for me",US,2021-01-15
3,Too Thin,"The materials on the fabric just way too thin, I do not feel that there's sufficient protection. I wonder if there can be a layer of protection added to perfect the masks.",US,2020-10-28
3,They are huge,I read all the comments about these being too small but mine are HUGE. The elastic that goes around the ears is really long and not adjustable. They will not stay up on my face.,US,2020-08-18
3,Too loose around the sides and top,"Works ok as a ‚Äúsafety‚Äù mask when outdoors or with small groups for a short amount of time. The mask does not fit snuggly around the nose, so more likely to let germs in. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it to the grocery store or anyplace I plan to be in close proximity to others. To be fair, it is not advertised as a medical-grade mask. But there are other non-medical masks that fit more snuggly so you feel better protected/protecting.",US,2020-09-04
3,"Thin cloth, large is tooo big","We got the large masks after reading some reviews, and they are too big even for my husband who is 6ft tall and doesn‚Äôt have a thin face by any means.
Material isn't as thick as I would have liked it to be. It seems to be made of some scrap cloth. It‚Äôs not sturdy.",US,2020-10-26
3,Doesn‚Äôt fit well around nose,"Doesn‚Äôt fit well around my nose. It starts to fall down when talking, have to pull it up. Needs a bendable metal strip sown in like many paper face masks. Even the large fits a little small. It looks nice tho and has 2 layers of fabric which is a plus. And it smells nice too!",US,2020-08-22
3,Not adjustable so plan accordingly,"I bought these because the inner layer is not white. They are a good size, but the ear loops on one were so loose I had to purchase sizing straps so I could wear it. You might have to work with them but it‚Äôs a pretty decent set",US,2020-08-09
3,Large size runs small,"I am happy with the quality of this product and the over design. However with that being said I did order the Large size in hopes that they would fit better than current masks that I have. Unfortunately they did not fit very well, I don't know if the models have a small face or if I just have to large of a head (Don't ask my wife). I would recommend this product to anyone that has a smaller face, but as for myself they are useless.",US,2020-10-20
3,Small even the large. One is small.,"Made in mexico. Quality is not great. Ordered the large that will work but no extra material. One of them is definitely smaller than the other two.
Not impressed.",US,2020-08-10
3,Theyre fashionable and fit my face well.,"Super cute, comfy, and well made EXCEPT for the elastic for around the ears. They were WAYYYY too long for me so I had to tie knots, and those are very difficult to get out to readjust. I wish they were adjustable or less long. Otherwise they're great. I got the large, don't get the small unless you're a kid.",US,2020-09-04
3,Too small for adult man,Even the large size mask is too small for an adult male. If you open your mouth it slips down under your nose. The material is thin and would be appropriate for outdoor activities if it fit better.,US,2020-08-16

I wish the elastic ear straps were cords.",US,2020-10-29
3,Fit too big,"If you are looking for a looser fitted mask then this will definitely get the job done. It only comes in two sizes and since I am an adult I got the larger size because it says the small size runs really small. With that being said, the large size runs pretty large. The design and color are nice though!",US,2020-08-25

3,Size is not accurate with product,I bought these for my husband because the size/measurements was what I was looking for. When they came in the mail I immediately noticed that they looked too small. I pulled them out and they barely comfortably covered my mouth and nose. I ordered a Large but the size seems more like a medium or so. Not the exact measurements they stated.,US,2020-08-19
3,Wayyyy to big,"Can‚Äôt imagine the size that your head needs to be for this to fit, 4 of us tried it on and it sagged away from our face very loosely. We returned them.",US,2020-11-10
3,A little too big,There were only two sizes available so I got the large. The fit if the actual mask is good and covers the face but the straps are a little too long and the mask slips off the nose. Nothing a little sewing can't fix.,US,2021-01-16

1,"Incorrect sizing, Poor fit and falls off constantly, Thick and hot","Overall, the mask is made of high quality materials. However, the design, size and overall functionality of the mask are very poor.

1) Incorrect sizing: Their website originally only showed 1 sizing. That of the nose-to-ear measurements. My first order was for a mask to fit my head size. When it arrived, the mask was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller vertically and wasn't side enough to cover my nose at all, but did hold on my face behind my ears well. After reviewing their product on their website, they instantly deleted my comments and suggestions and then uploaded a second sizing chart that showed the vertical sizes from chin-to-nose. Great I thought. I'll simply order one based on those dimensions. In fact I ordered a size larger planning that their sizing was incorrect / too small given my first experience. Nope, even the size up as you can see in the picture BARELY fit from my chin to my nose. I measured a few friends and family and all had RELATIVELY similar dimension to mine. Therefore, their sizing, which is a blueprint/design sizing chart did not take into account the overall shape and actual form on the face into account when providing sizing. Now I have a mask that barely fits vertically, falls off constantly, and fits very loose behind the ears.

2) FIT: The Lrg mask hardly even fits from my chin to my nose. The moment I open my mouth or speak, it falls off my nose and I am forced to CONSTANTLY readjust it. I would give 0 stars if I could for this alone.

3) THICK AND HOT: As many many users have pointed out, the mask is made from (quality) thick materials which makes breathing hot and heavy even under minor exertion. The mask consistently gets 'wet' and heavy and falls off the face VERY easily. On top of that, now that winter has arrived, the hot air escapes directly up into your eyes which is definitely not what you want for contagion reasons, but also simple comfort and function, let alone the fact that you can't wear glasses with the mask because it instantly fogs them. Yet again, a poor design with quality materials.

OVERALL: I expected a sports mask that fits well, doesn't impede your workouts constantly, sizing is accurate and vents and/or 'filters' your heavy breathing so as to prevent spreading of germs. Unfortunately this mask fails to live up to any of those standards. I would say though, as a standard mask that I keep in my pocket for going in and out of stores and what not doing my daily activities, it is mostly comfortable (provided I don't speak and thus doesn't fall of my nose) haha. Ya, not only is this mask not worth the money, it is a severely poor designed product and doesn't function as it should. I STRONGLY do NOT recommend this product to anyone unless you like wasting money. I simply use a cheap double layer cotton mask with charcoal vent for working out now. At least it actually functions and works as intended.",Canada,2020-12-07

1,Not recommended for sports,"Comfortable to wear, very thick, good seal. However it does not serve it‚Äôs designed purpose of being a sports mask.

1,Much too small and can't return,I have a small face and nose so I ordered the small/medium. It doesn't even go to the bottom of my chin. This seems like an item that would fit a child. It's disappointing that you can't return items you have tried on in covid-19 days.,US,2021-02-05

2,Horribly place seam on nose,"This mask could have been great, but due to a badly placed seam right on the nose it feels terrible. I was looking forward to having a mask that actually fit my face, which this one does, but the seam rubs across the top of the nose and produces instant irritation. To the garbage it goes, as I can't imagine the company would want this back after being on my face for 10 minutes.",US,2020-12-23

1,Itchy Material and Impossible to Breathe Comfortably!,"I wish I had good things to say about this facemask. I am customed to wear a facemask in public now, and always do when I step outside or going to stores, etc., but I wanted a mask that looked dressier than the white clinical masks that I usually use. I picked the ‚Äú3pcs/Pack Dust Masks Breathable Reusable for Outdoor Sport‚Ä¶‚Äù because they would look better with dressier clothing, as well as when I walk my dogs outside. Today when I was going on a walk with my dog, I decided to try my new mask; it was awful! The material is way too thick, and it makes your skin itch. I am going to continue to see if I can find a nice looking mask that I can actually wear and be comfortable in.",US,2020-07-17
1,Not comfortable,"They are very thick, to the point of making it slightly uncomfortable to breathe, especially more than a few minutes. It appears they are 3 different sizes, but only the large one fits me. That means I don‚Äôt have any replacements when I lose one. The small would only fit kids or really small adults. They elastic pulls hard on your ears. I don‚Äôt understand why they are rated so highly.",US,2020-06-24
1,Smell weird,"I am not picking with mask, anything that would cover my face would work, so I bought this cheapest available on Amazon, it works below what I expected.

Figure it's just 15 bucks wasted, not too big a deal, I reckon. Eventually I decided to just order some standard disposable masks. They are WAY better. Don't waste your money on these.",US,2020-09-26

1,A Rare 1-Star Product,"Bottom Line on Top: A Waste of Money at Half the Price. Seriously Pointless.

I don't usually give five- or one-star reviews, but this product is just... bad. It's too small for anyone over the age of nine, too thick to breathe through comfortably, too tight on the ears and just overall too cheaply made. No one in the family wanted them after a few minutes of wear. They even failed as glass-cleaning cloths before they finally reached the bin. Of the six brands and styles we tried, we settled on  B08BWBQ3T3 , which is far better engineered, really comfortable and large enough to be effective. Yes, costs more. But what's the point of saving money if no one will want to use what you buy?

Full disclosure: No on pays me for reviews and I pay full price for everything that I review. I mention a competing product simply because this one is so utterly useless.",US,2020-08-07
1,"Very Small, inadequate for a healthy fitting mask","These may be ok for kid size, maybe.... maybe not üò∑ sewn down the middle so you can slip a silicone bridge for comfort in them.

1,Waste of money,"Waste of money. Worse masks I ever bought. They're Huge, block my vision, squish my nose but yet there's an air gap on the sides of my nose, pull on my ears, can not breathe through them at all. I'd send them back but the return window has closed.",US,2020-11-20
1,Don't buy these.,They're itchy and overall uncomfortable. Also they're not the same as advertised. Look at the ear on the man in the 4th photograph. A mask is photoshopped on his face.,US,2020-08-06
1,Too small,Way too small. Can‚Äôt use it wish I can return it!,US,2021-01-26
1,Crap,These masks are a joke. They are very small and poorly made.,US,2020-06-04
1,Doesn't fit an average size head,"Came a day after I needed it (delivery was a day late). Also said one size fits all and if you consider pulling your ears off, a fit, then yeah, it fits everyone. I have a pretty average size head so I was surprised I could barely put it on.",US,2020-08-05
1,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,"I feel like I have a bra cup on my face. Doesn‚Äôt fit right, very loose.",US,2020-06-10

1,Small,Very small,US,2020-06-16
1,Not worth it,Very thick mask. The straps are huge and have no support. Odd shape. Not comfortable at all.,US,2020-10-03
2,they're alright - thick material,"Fabric going over the nose wire is too thin - wire is already poking through after 1 wash
I liked the thicknesss of the fabric on your face.
straps fits comfortably.",Canada,2020-11-24
2,garbage,quality is really nice but you really cant breathe on these ones. what a waste of purchase!,Canada,2020-11-14
2,Small and hard to breathe more than normal,"Quite difficult to breath in, elastic pulls down on your ears, feels like this should be a kiddie mask.",US,2020-06-02
2,Too small for adult,"These seem well made. The material is heavy and I wanted to like them but they are just too small from top to bottom. If you pull them up to cover your nose they won't stay under your chin so you can't get a good tight fit. Might work for a child, not an adult.",US,2020-06-14
2,did not fit over ears,"The masks are well made and sturdy looking. But the ear loops were too tight over my and my husband's ears, and uncomfortable. The cords are very thick and not stretchy enough. They did not work. I gave them to a friend who they fit better, but they appeared tight on him, too. So unfortunately, I can't give these a better rating just based on the ear loops.",US,2020-06-28
2,Not the best feeling material,I got black masks to look better in public. I disliked having a medical mask on and how that looked. These do look better but they are not sleek or that nice feeling. They are thick with something between the two layers. I guess thats added protection. Does not seal around the nose. I wish they used a better material outside so it looks sporty.,US,2020-08-10
2,Misleading pictures,"I'm a 5'3"" average sized guy. This mask is too small for me. It may be ok for a 30-minute trip to the store, but i needed something i could wear at work (8 hours or more a day). this is NOT that type of mask. The mask is really tight. And i'm sure all the people in the picture are larger/taller than me, so why are they all smiling? This mask is really tight and pulls on your ears. You're definitely better off avoiding this product.",US,2020-09-21
2,Decent but small,"Definitely thought these masks would be a bit larger. They are too small for my average sized head and much too small for anyone who thinks their head is slightly larger than normal (you know who you are). If you‚Äôre worried about whether or not these masks will fit, then they probably won‚Äôt.",US,2020-08-14
2,Very hard to breath,"The masks are soft and a nice shape. They were a little small for everyone in the family, even more so after washing.
The straps for the mask are short also, so they would be good for smaller faces. However, the fabric is so thick it is very hard to breath. If you are looking for thicker masks, this would be good. We are keeping them around for back-ups, but avoid having to use them as they are just too thick to breath through.",US,2020-07-13
2,Like breathing through a wool comforter.,"The mask size is perfect and the ear straps are comfortable. If I close my eyes with the mask on I could imagine what it would be like to be chloroformed from behind with a big rag. The fabric is tremendously thick. If I didn't need the masks for my work staff today, I would return them.",US,2020-10-15
2,Inconsistent sizing...,"I bought these masks first back in October, and they quickly became hands-down my favorite masks for everyday use and exercise. They stay on when working out, are breathable and thicker than any other masks I've found. The earloops are stretchy and comfortable. So I went and bought two more packs this December, however the masks that arrived were completely different sizing from the original set I had loved so much. They were way too big for my face, with earloops too long to even hold the mask on. Very disappointed and will be returning this second batch.",US,2020-12-29
2,Too small for adults,My husband and I both tried this on and the ear loops were so small that it made the mask difficult to breathe in. We are not large people; both size XS or S in women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs clothing respectively.,US,2020-08-25
2,So thick you can't breath through it,"It is so thick that you can barely breath through it, and i sweat like crazily under the mask it must be filtering out all the air possible. Isn't the most stretchy mask out there but also not one of the most snugged either so it doesn't serve it purpose",US,2021-01-24
2,Makes my ears stick out!,"Not elastic enough. No stretch. I have an average size head. I shouldn't have this problem.

My 6 year old daughter can wear this comfortably. But the lack of stretch makes the fit tight on me, and makes my ears stick out.

This should be sold as being for children, NOT adults.",US,2020-08-31
2,Not comfy,These masks were too small to thick and not very comfortable I was hoping for a different feel to them since I have to wear them all day,US,2020-12-20
2,wears out,"After a few washes it starts to get the lint balls on it. Not a bad mask for the money, but it is get what you pay for here. Once it starts to wear out it start losing comfort.",US,2021-01-30
2,Not the same product as the original,These are a reorder. The originals are larger and have a flexible nose conforming wire. These are smaller and have no wire.,US,2020-10-08
2,Too small for many adults,"Overall these are well made, but unfortunately they‚Äôre too small for an adult. The mask will slip off of my nose if I open the mouth at all. That defeats the entire point of wearing a mask at all, especially if you need to interact with people. I‚Äôll see if any friends with children can use these, this is wasted money for me.",US,2020-10-13
2,Don‚Äôt recommend buying,This mask is very thick and the straps are very large. I hated it and it was too big to fit my face and/or on my ears so I gave these away. Not great - the mask material is not very breathable,US,2020-11-27
2,Too thick to breath,These masks are incredibly thick and hard to breath with. My daughter has asthma and cannot wear these masks without her breathing suffering. They are small and hardly stretch.,US,2020-10-16
2,Ear loop to small,"The material that goes over your ear is not very stretchy. I could barely fit them over my ears, would be very uncomfortable for long periods of use. These would probably fit a teenager or older kid comfortably but in my opinion they are not comfortable for adults.",US,2020-08-20
2,Very small face mask and they don‚Äôt stretch,These face masks are good quality however they are extremely small they fit tight on your face they are more for women or children in my opinion,US,2020-08-16
2,Too small,The mask part is pretty thick but it's way too small and the loops barely stretch,US,2020-09-22

2,"Too thick, too big","Too thick, and too big..which is saying something because I have a big head.",US,2020-11-05
2,Mask is too small and doesn't seal on the bridge of the nose.,Don't get this for coronavirus protection. There is no metal band to mold it to the nose so it leaves quite large gaps. It's a pretty thick combination of fabric too. It's not really uncomfortable but seems like a pretty small mask. Sometimes slips off my ears and doesnt for far enough under my chin. As I talk it pulls it down off my nose.,US,2020-07-01
2,Too small for adult male. OK for kids,"Too small. Won‚Äôt stretch over my ears with bending them. I‚Äôm a tall, adult male, fwiw",US,2020-09-07

2,Mask,Too hot and too tight,US,2020-10-03
2,NOT Breathable,"These masks would be good for warm weather, but they are not breathable. I have several other cloth masks that are lighter and breathable, but these feel like two layers of felted wool on your face. They look good, but they're very hot, a little rough, and too fuzzy for any type of warm weather.",US,2020-08-03
2,Looks cool but not very comfortable.,The ear loops aren‚Äôt stretchy so if it runs a bit small on you you‚Äôre going to feel a bit of strain on your ears. Due to it running a bit tight on me it was not very comfortable and easy to breathe with it on.,US,2020-11-27
2,hurts ears,The dimensions are wrong which make this feel small and pull on my ears the entire time. It is also hard to breathe.,US,2020-07-02
2,Great if you wanna look like a duck with a,The fit on these are horrible. There‚Äôs a huge seam down the middle that makes you look like a walking face triangle. On top of that the ear loops will stretch out and never return to shape. Waste of money honestly.,US,2020-08-12
2,too small,"pinched ears, no way to adjust. returned",US,2020-09-28
2,Very thick and tight,This mask doesn't stretch very well. It hurts my ears and pulls in them. It's very thick and not breathable if it's warm outside. It may be a good mask for cold weather if the ear loops were a bit more stretchy.,US,2020-10-14
2,Wouldn‚Äôt repurchase,Too small for me (average sized adult female) pulls my ears forward,US,2020-11-01
2,Does not breath well..,The Material is to think and does not breath well at all. I would not recommend buying this product.,US,2020-09-14
2,"Thick, difficult to breathe","Ordered these since they're black and go with my uniform at the restaurant where I work. 3 minutes into work and breathing is not easy, let alone hours on end. Will be looking for a MUCH thinner option.",US,2020-07-01
2,VERY small,"The fabric is great and comfortable, but the masks themselves are so small that I'm unable to use them. For children but not for adults.",US,2020-06-27
2,Too Small,Despite reading other reviews saying that these masks are small I purchased them. And yes they‚Äôre too small. It‚Äôs a shame the maker wouldn‚Äôt add on inch of material to make them larger. That would have gotten five stars from me.,US,2020-08-19
2,Mask is too heavy,The fit was too tight and the fabric was too heavy. Could not breathe thru the thing. Would not buy them again.,US,2020-06-27
2,Material is Too thick!,It‚Äôs too thick. And not. Breathable.,US,2020-08-07
2,size issue,size is not consistent. One pack was perfect. The second pack was too small even for my 9 years old child. The issue is with the loop that goes around the ear. it is too short and thick. Very uncomfortable to wear as it bends the ears forward.,US,2020-07-22
2,uncomfortable and did not fit well,uncomfortable and did not fit well,US,2020-11-20

2,not comfortable,the material separates and it always feels like the cloth is trying to go into your mouth.,US,2020-11-06
2,Too small,These are great masks for children but too small for adults b/c of the way the mask fits vertically.,US,2021-01-16
2,Made for small to average size people,"These are nice enough masks, HOWEVER they are made for small to average size people. If you are average to large size, even though they do stretch, it is not comfortable.",US,2020-07-16
2,Not stretchy and thick,"Very thick, awkward fit, pulls my ears down",US,2021-01-20

2,"Very small, no stretch masks with too-thick ear loops","You get what you pay for. Super-cheap masks on Amazon? Don't plan on quality!

These are really small. Like so small I can barely cover my nose and chin at the same time, and then only if I don't speak. I generally consider myself an average-sized human with an average-sized face, so there's that. And I speak, as I imagine you do, too. Something to consider.

The ear loops are really thick, stitched pieces. They are not comfortable behind the ears, as that thickness makes my ears resemble Alfred E. Neuman's. My ears don't normally do that, just so you know. And the ear loops don't stretch. At all.

If you order these after reading this review, well, good for you for taking a chance. You ought to play the lottery. Your chances of achieving happiness are better there than with these masks.",US,2020-11-12
2,Gave me a rash,"I bought these because of all the people stating that this mask could not possibly fit an adult. Yet, here I am, dishing out more money on a product that doesn't fit my 25 year old face. I decided to fix it myself; I cut the straps and sewed it to be smaller. That fixed the size problem, but now another problem has arose; IT'S SO FREAKING ITCHY. Like, if I even begin to sweat a little bit, I feel like I'm going to break out in a rash because its so itchy. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because the fit isn't terrible after I adjusted it.

Update: I now have a rash across my face from this material. I'm so frustrated because I can't return them since I modified them. I hate these so much.",US,2020-10-27
2,"Small, stinky, not well made and hot","The masks are very small and are uncomfortable on people with larger heads. Due to the small size, the mask constantly slips off my nose. The only upside to that is I no longer have to smell it, because these things smell like stinky feet. They are also not made very well, as two out of my three had stitching coming apart out of the bag. They are very thick and not breathable at all causing instant sweating in the Florida heat.",US,2020-06-25
2,Very hot and smelly mask. Doubt cotton,"They smelled awful when they arrived. After washing they still had an odd, unpleasant order when I wore it. They are thick but I am not convinced they are cotton as described. It made my face sweat a lot, literally making it dripping wet. I wore it in a cold grocery store. I would not recommend this product.",US,2020-07-16
2,These only fit the Kids Comfortably!!,"After ordering masks 4 times, I finally land this pack of 3! Tried one on, and could barely get it on, gave it a bunch of good stretches, still way to tight! My Wife tried one, same thing, 13 yr old daughter now has 3 masks that fit her just right! If you like to have your ears looking like a monkey, or just plain ripped off,,, These Are for You!!",US,2020-06-12
2,No airflow,"My husband and I cannot stand these. We are both essential workers wearing masks since March 2020 so we are not strangers to functioning with masks on. However, these are designed to barely let any airflow through. Way too think and stuffy.",US,2020-10-06
2,Meh,"Not super comfortable, a little stiff / thick, but not in a good way... in a way that is uncomfortable on your nose. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend or buy again, but would do the job for quick tasks (not all day long wear).",US,2020-11-06
2,Get something else,"This product is inadequate. Primarily, the issue is fit. The masks are too small, and the bands that go around your ears do not stretch. For me, it pulls my ears forward, which is uncomfortable and looks ridiculous.",US,2020-08-27

The disposable ones I wear at work are irritating my skin so I wanted one that would be extra soft and not irritating. These are perfect. And it might be silly but the black fabric goes with everythingüòÅ and I like the simplicity

Update. Tried wearing them all day at work.. yes they are soft but the material was too thick. Felt hot and suffocating. I won‚Äôt wear them for all day or on a hot day",US,2020-09-02
3,Very Thick,"These masks are very thick. It‚Äôs hard to breath in them, especially in the 95 degrees weather we have been having. The actual make of the masks is good and so is the stretch. If you are looking for a very thick mask, this may be for you.",US,2020-08-18
3,Quality but smallish,"These black cotton cloth masks have a quality feel to them, but, they are somewhat small on this man (me). Pulls on my ears a little too much. I will say that they do fit my wife's face just fine. Could be better on the breathability, seems to hold your hot breathe in mask too much. But they work in a pinch when you need one.",US,2020-08-12
3,THICK AF,"Thick? Yes...yes they are. It's like a maxi-pad with ear straps. While they are soft, it's literally as thick as a double-ply sweatshirt. They would be perfect in the winter, but during the summer.... nope.",US,2020-07-14
3,Straps are thick and uncomfortable,"These masks are really thick and will probably useful in winter, however, the straps are extremely thick and I find them to be too uncomfortable around the earsüòñ They don't really stay put and are even worse when im wearing my glasses.

I won't order again.",US,2020-07-20
3,"Comfortable to wear, but a bit too thick","I had been using the blue disposable masks, but wanted something black in color and without the adjustable ear loops. These masks are comfortable to wear, but the thickness made breathing a bit more difficult and moisture built up inside rather quickly. Overall. I like the mask.",US,2020-10-08
3,Very Thick,These are fairly comfortable except they are soo thick. It fits well to my face and was nice because I did not feel like I was sucking the mask in through my nose when i would breathe but I could not get over how thick they were ended up not using them at all and bought different ones. Waste of money,US,2020-09-08
3,Quality it good,"Update: a little big. The material is light, you don't get too hot if you wear these to work. But ti be on the safe side I would wear a medical mask under since there isn't a filter

3,"Keep searching, these aren‚Äôt the ones you want","These weren‚Äôt bad when we first bought them and it was cooler outside. The summer heat is now here in NYC and it‚Äôs impossible to wear these. The description describes these masks as something runners can wear but I disagree - not during summertime at least. I compared these to a similar, less thick brand and to medical masks - these masks made me sweat more and were extremely stuffy by comparison. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend for weather above 80 degrees + humid.",US,2020-07-19
3,"I was hoping, since reading another review, that I wouldn't have fogged up glasses while wearing.",These masks are not worth the money. I wanted a mask that would not fog up my eyeglasses. These are not what I am looking for. A waste of money. Hard to breathe through also.,US,2020-06-22
3,Soft n thick but chokes my ears..,The mask r very soft n feel great on my face even though it's pretty thick. The ear loops r too short n pull my ears forward n this makes it uncomfortable. This is a great mask 4 kids.,US,2020-07-15
3,"A positive note, they are soft on my face",These masks did not work for me so great. They were too thick and felt not so breathable. they are definitely soft and they feel nice against my face but I think I need a mask that fits my face better or has adjustable straps.,US,2020-10-18
3,"Look good, but aren't the best quality","One ear strap was longer than the other, and they are pretty thick and hard to breathe in. They looked good and formal for a wedding, but definitely not the best quality.",US,2020-10-04
3,Good for some. Safe,These were on the thicker side for me to wear daily for 12 hours to teach in the south. My daughter prefers these than others. It‚Äôs just a matter of preference.,US,2020-09-15
3,Ehh,Feel the ear loop straps are too tight and pull your ears forward. Have a hard time keeping it on. Very thick and not breathable for exercising.,US,2020-07-25
3,"good masks, but the straps barely fit around the ears.","I purchased these a few months ago, and still use them almost everyday.

However, i've had to stretch them out *quite* a bit as these kept slipping off my ears because they are too small to fit around my face/ears. Good masks and they're comfortable, but make the ear holders better IMO.",US,2020-10-27
3,Keep looking,"These just fit around my (5'11"" male) ears and face, but it's borderline. The nose does not seal well at all though. If I'm wearing glasses they immediately fog up, and if I were to sneeze it'd shoot into my eyes. Hair and lint also cling to the material unlike the disposable masks. I ordered a 50pk of the blue ones with the nose wire to wear instead as they're more comfortable and provide greater protection.",US,2020-06-18
3,Useful,They are comfortable and work fine. They are a bit thick and make it a little hard to breath but overall they get the job done and if we still need them in the cooler months they might be better,US,2020-07-03
3,Small,Do not like them. They‚Äôre small and make my ears hurt. I‚Äôm a petite woman and they pull too hard on my ears,US,2021-01-08
3,Bad quality,Thick material but i washed them one time and they lost all their stretch and now they‚Äôre just sagging when I put them on...,US,2020-06-28
3,Not safe,"Not low enough on the chin and definitely no protection around the nose, but very comfortable, just not safe.",US,2020-09-23
3,Very thick,"They came quick but they are very hard to breath in. I know it‚Äôs a mask but I‚Äôve used the ‚Äúsurgical‚Äù masks all throughout quarantine and I found them to be much easier to breathe in then these were, yes even when worn correctly pinching the nose. The fabric has two layers which is what makes them so thick. Also I feel like they pull your ears because it‚Äôs a little small and they don‚Äôt have a lot of give.",US,2020-06-29
3,"Looks great, but no protection for corona","It looks great and you feel fashionable... but it doesn't help with protection from rona, find something else that'll protect you from the virus",US,2020-07-18
3,Defective mask,One of the masks in the pack is made incorrectly. The one ear hole is way bigger than the other. Other then that they aren‚Äôt horrible.,US,2020-06-07
3,Works but thick,Fits well but is too thick to wear for more than a few minutes at a time. Gets hot quickly when wearing outside. Great for quick errands but not for all day comfort.,US,2020-09-02
3,May or may not fit your face,"Maybe my ears are further back on my head than normal, but these are extremely tight and uncomfortable to wear. Good quality, material is fine, just doesn't fit me.",US,2020-10-05
3,Ok,The mask is a little hot. The air doesn‚Äôt flow well. It is mostly comfortable. Does look good,US,2020-07-01
3,Kind of thick and run's small,This is more suitable for a child or teen with a small face. It is also thick.,US,2021-02-03
3,Too small.,I‚Äôm an adult male. These are pretty small. Wash it once and they‚Äôll be too small I‚Äôm afraid.,US,2020-06-20
3,Very cheap but somewhat effective.,Very cheap but somewhat effective. Regular disposable hospital masks are much better quality.,US,2020-06-25
3,Heavy,Little heavier than I expected but they fit good with nose grip,US,2020-10-20
3,Fit small and are thick,The product looks like it does in the picture. The material is soft. It is very thick though (warm) and they fit very small. If you have a beard or a medium to large face do not get these. The product seems to hold up fine though.,US,2020-07-12
3,No nose wire,"No nose wire, so if you wear glasses, expect condensation...",US,2020-09-03
3,thick but comfy,"This are very thick mask, they do stretch to fit they dont hurt youre ears like other ones do. It fits my 4yo my 11yo and myself very well. Definitely a one size fits most to almost all.",US,2020-10-03
3,Would not recommend,Seems small.. not a good fit.. would not recommend,US,2020-09-12
3,To thick and hot,"These work fine, fit fine. My biggest complaint- they are thick and if you live in a hot humid climate, it‚Äôs like wearing a sweater on your face in 90 degree weather. In winter time, would be great. They would keep your nose and chin warm. In summer, too hot.",US,2020-07-31
3,For Larger Faces,"I like the quality of the mask, it's really well made and thick, but they are made for someone with a larger head. The straps around the ears are really thick, so hard to stay on. These are not good for my teenage daughter or myself, but great for my husband.",US,2020-10-10
3,Works better if you don‚Äôt have a small face.,"The material is thick enough. However, these masks are not a good fit for my face. It‚Äôs way too big and be sliding down too often. I wish the straps were adjustable.",US,2020-10-27
3,Good,A little suffocating for work.. but great for errands,US,2020-07-24
3,Super cute but not a great fit,"A little bit small, pulled my ears forward a lot.. probably perfect for petite faces or children",US,2020-08-03
3,Smaller than expected,"Looks good, feels good, but too small for my face. Can't cover both my chin or nose without it slipping off of one or the other. Gave the other 2 to friends with smaller faces & fit them fine.

If you have a larger, more superior face, buy something else.",US,2020-11-13
3,Just ok,"They seem well-made. They are made of very thick cloth material which I think is good in some ways. However, this makes it harder to breath through than other masks I've worn. Additionally, the ear loops are a bit small and do not have as much stretch as I wanted.",US,2020-08-13
3,Kinda small,The masks are so small and the fit is really tight. Perfect for maybe a teen in middle school.,US,2020-08-13
3,Mediocre,Very mediocre- ear loops are very thick and pull my ears forward- no stretch. Moderate coverage- thick fabric.,US,2020-11-14
3,Uncomfortably tight against the face,"The physical size of the masks is on the small side and it's uncomfortably tight against the face when you try to fully cover the nose and mouth. Because these masks fit so tight against the face, it makes breathing a bit labored.",US,2020-08-26
3,Not as comfortable as I'd like,"It was a little too small for me, a grown man. Maybe for women it would be better. I don't have an abnormally large head.",US,2020-11-26
3,Somewhat uncomfortable but not terrible,These are ok. The material is thick and durable and will likely stand up to a few washes. The straps that go around the ears are a little small and pull my ears forward and are overall not super comfortable. I don't plan on wearing them for long periods of time.,US,2020-08-03
3,"Look Nice, Thick","They look nice and are thick and soft, but the elastic was no where near strong enough for my face size, they don't adjust to the size you need. Was very loose around the sides and nose. Might work better for someone with a larger face.",US,2020-10-20
3,Heavy,Very thick and heavy but seem to fit larger faces better,US,2020-10-04
3,Ehh. Not worth the money.,"The mask is very small. (Doesn‚Äôt cover my chin.) the material makes it very hard to breath and gets very sweaty.

I would not recommend these.",US,2020-09-06
3,Very thick,These are probably going to be perfect in the winter if we are still needing masks. But it will be risky as they are so incredibly thick. Feels like youre wearing a sweatshirt on your face.,US,2020-07-07
3,they shrink a lot when you wash them,they shrank so much they are uncomfortable to wear. also they are so think you cant breath easy in them.,US,2020-09-14
3,Thick material,The ear straps are nice but these are so small and so thick. Not as breathable as other masks,US,2020-07-13
3,Wool Muzzle,"Extra thick, extra hot, weird form to them, aesthetically less appealing. Like a wool sweater for your face. Could be ok in winter?",US,2020-07-25
3,too small,"the ear loops are not long enough, it pulls my ears. makes me feel like dumbo",US,2020-11-19
3,Smaller than advertised,"Smaller than advertised. Width is just a shade under 8"", but nose to chin is just under 5"", not 5.5"" as advertised. Nice enough mask and I'll give them to my son, but I ordered them for me and they are just too small",US,2020-09-16
3,Not great,Very thick mask which can make it hard to breath at times. Material is quite itchy on the skin.,US,2020-10-02
3,Very thick material,I did not like these masks they are thick and feel more like wool. Very hot and hard to breath. Wish I didn‚Äôt purchase since you can‚Äôt return.,US,2020-11-05
3,not the best not the worst,these are so thick and not very breathable!,US,2020-10-28
3,Too small,They‚Äôre too small for me. When I try to adjust it up or down parts of my face that are supposed to be covered by the mask are exposed. I have a medium sized face. I feel like these would be great for kids! Easy to breathe through.,US,2020-06-07
3,Bigger than expected,"I thought these were cotton, but there a thicker more jersey-like material, which isn‚Äôt bad. They are a bit large, and I had to try to shrink them to not sag off my nose.",US,2020-10-19
3,Big and warm,"These are very thick, and are a bit much for a hot summer day. Additionally, the ear loops are giant. I had to alter them to fit my adult, female head.",US,2020-09-14
3,Color,Hard on the fact,US,2021-01-19
3,"very thick, gets really hot fast","it attracts lint and hair very easily, i sweat after wearing them for 2 minutes, ear loops are pretty loose, the material is almost like a sweater and it gets very hot in florida",US,2020-09-13
3,Dont like it,The material is too thick. Cant breathe while using. Its already too hot outside.,US,2020-07-01
3,Small. Wont fit my face.,"Very small. If you are an adult male of average American size, do not buy. If you are small female or buying for a child it would probably be fine.",US,2020-08-01
3,Not cotton,"Definitely not cotton, feels and looks like polyester. ok to wear for short periods of time but gets very hot. Material is pretty thick and stiff.",US,2020-08-03
3,Ok mask,A nice thick mask but the ear loops have no stretch/give. It would be a better mask if the ear loops had more flexibility.,US,2020-11-04
3,Size not accurate,Just didn‚Äôt fit. To small for an adult male. Would be fine for child. Otherwise they seem to be made well.,US,2020-07-10
3,"Pretty good, thick straps",Straps are too thick which pulls my ears out. Otherwise thickness is awesome!!,US,2021-01-06
3,Tight for a large person,A little small for a large sized person.,US,2020-08-09
3,Too small,"Face piece is too small. Ear lace is short. Mask shrunk after wash.
Good material/fabric",US,2020-08-06
3,Not What I Expected,Not What I Expected... It‚Äôs Like Wearing A Pad Over Your Nose üòë,US,2020-09-11
3,Thick ear hooks,"The mask has good coverage but the ear hooks are very thick, almost difficult to keep the mask on. Also, all three masks were slightly different sizes.",US,2020-12-12
3,Small,"They are kinda small, great for teen boys",US,2020-07-19
3,Great price but okay in certain settings,The face masks are soft and easy to wash but I wouldn‚Äôt advise wearing them in the summer or in humid climates.,US,2020-07-01
3,Ear straps are too long,Nice product with the exception that the ears straps were way to long and caused the mask to constantly fall below my nose.,US,2020-09-25
3,Not symmetrical face mask,The mask is a bit uneven. Otherwise it‚Äôs OK. It does the job.,US,2020-08-09
3,Okay i guess,"Honestly the masks were a bit too thick and large for our liking, and the ear loops were lopsided too",US,2020-08-01
3,Small mask,Did not fit my face. Had to order XL size.,US,2020-07-27
3,Not great,Didn‚Äôt care for them,US,2020-08-15
3,Make sure that you Wash it,One of them came dirty,US,2020-09-01
3,Small but ok,There a little small so I cant wear them which sucks but imma keep them still lol,US,2020-07-14
3,Works for kids,They don‚Äôt fit my face. Average adult male face. Work great for kids,US,2020-09-01

3,Mask,No comment,US,2020-07-17
3,Too thick,Too thick and doesn‚Äôt stay on your ears,US,2020-08-28
3,Warm,Pretty hot but I am in Florida,US,2020-06-10
3,"Unfortunately, smaller than expected.","3 stars for the quality of the material. The material is a rather thick cloth so these masks will be great to use in the cold outdoors during wintertime.

However, I bought these masks for my father who has a rather large face/lower jaw. The masks don't fit him at all to the point where he can't stretch the loops to his ears. I expected something larger based on the pictures.

Do recommend for ladies with smaller faces.",US,2020-06-11
3,Super Thick Masks,"These masks were a great price compared to what we have locally. The plain black works for everyone in our family (I have a few that are too ""girly"" for the guys!) and the loops stretch to fit everyone's head. However, they are very thick. When I pulled it out of the package, I wondered when I'd ordered a bra from Amazon because they feel just like the cups of a bra. They are very stiff - haven't washed yet, so I'm not sure if they'll become more pliable.",US,2020-09-08
3,Can't breathe through it,"I liked this mask for the first few minutes of wearing it, but after 30min, I could barely breathe in the mask. It fits well and looks good. But the material seems too thick and I have gone back to the disposable masks for breathing comfort. We bought a three-pack and all three users (after varying durations of trying to make this work) have gone back to disposable masks. Do not buy.",US,2020-10-01
3,"Okay for kids, slips off adults","For kids this is fine, should get larger size for adults. When wearing, as soon as I‚Äôd talk, the mask would move because of jaw movements and then slip off and reveal my nose. Would have to constantly readjust which defeats the purchase of avoiding touching your face.",US,2020-11-01
3,Too Small for Long Faces,"Well made mask, but a touch too small if you have a long face... apparently I‚Äôm part horse.",US,2020-06-08
3,They work well,"They sit more comfortably one way than the other, but it's hard to tell easily which way is up. They stretch well also but the elastic is a little stiff and pulls my ears forward.",US,2020-11-03
3,Okay,"I don't know what the material they're using rough, I""ve washed them 2 times and they're still stiff and not very breathable. I'll use them for extras. The run big so beware.",US,2020-10-03
3,Made for small face - Not for average adult face,"The quality and construction are good and the mask is washable. The only complaint I have is that the mask is small for an average adult face. The mask slips up from the chin or down from the nose especially when you try to speak. Also, the ear hooks are tight & pull on the ear. I think the mask is better suited for a child's face (8-12 year old).",US,2020-09-09
3,Runs small,The mask is snug and comfortable but it is impossible to talk and not have to hold the mask adjusted to cover your mouth and nose.,US,2020-11-19
3,Handle Sewing not Properly Done,It's super thick and hard to breathe through. The earpiece sewing is very loose and will not take long to rip,US,2020-09-30
3,Good but don‚Äôt last.,"Loved these but after two washes, one already has a hole in it. I think I could sew it maybe but kind of disappointing.",US,2020-09-26
3,MaskS,These were not very stretchy and pulled my ears forward.,US,2020-09-30
3,Look elsewhere,These are thick and expensive for what they are.,US,2020-12-31
3,Black mask,I like the color and the fit but they are very hot and scratchy. The inside is like felt but soft and very hot to wear.,US,2020-09-12
3,Hot,"These are pretty thick and since I live in the south, they get hot quick.",US,2020-08-08
3,On the small side,"Rather small, would fit a tween/teen or an adult with a small face. The fabric is dense and it gets hot under the mask.",US,2020-08-17
3,Very small fit,Very small eat loops. Pulls your ears forward.,US,2020-06-24
3,Poor quality,These masks had a weird smell and did not fit very well.,US,2020-07-03
3,Dumbo ears,The loops for around my ears are short and pull my ears forward (I have a small to average size head for a female). The mask does stand out from my nose so that is nice but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these mask,US,2020-07-11
3,Good but small,I like mine but it's pretty tight on the ears it pulls them forward. I don't have a large head but it's in the average smaller category and these were tight.,US,2020-09-16
3,Very Small,"These are so small they would be for a child, not an adult. I don't suggest buying if you are not a very petite adult or child.",US,2020-12-01
3,Disappointing,Pulled on my ears and made them stick out. I gave these away.,US,2020-07-28
2,"Disappointed. Not a great fit, terrible elastic at ears.","These were a total let down. They feel and look great, but the elastic is terribly cheap, different lengths and mishaped. I bought 2 packs of 3 small size for my kids (so I didn't need to sew anymore) & only 1 out of 6 fit either child correctly. However, if you can sew they're very easily improved upon. They don't have a wire for the nose, so it constantly slips down under the chin. I sewed a bag tie to the seam and that's fixed the slipping. However the elastic was so stretched out on a few that I had to add beads to them and sew the elastic ends together to keep the beads just to allow for adjustment. I'm being literal when I say the one elastic was so stretched it fit around my head to a high ponytail.",Canada,2020-09-10
2,Masks cannot stay on your face at all if you open your mouth to talk.,"I have ordered the small, medium and XL sizes. For my 6 year old, 9 year old, wife and myself. These masks do not work. I have picked up masks from the corner store for less that work MUCH better (of course they are out of stock now). They fit okay - until you open your mouth - once. Then they fall off your nose forcing you to touch your face. Furthermore - they do not reduce your breath enough to stop the blow out the candle test. On top of all that - I feel hot and breathless when simply walking around with it on. I have ordered others - and continue to use disposables for now.",Canada,2020-09-22
2,Never fit,"The bad
‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨
1. Don't fit very well. Always came down below my son nose. What is the point of wearing the mask when the nose is exposed
2. I improvised the nose's metal holder and still none of them hold well.
3. Expensive for something worth 3 bucks.

The Good
‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨
Nothing good. They are junks. Woodworking is my hobby and I use the RZ masks for both woodworking and covid-19 protection. The RZ is much better and seal very well with internal filters. I wish the RZ have sizes for kids",Canada,2020-10-26
2,Too expensive for the quality,"I expected good quality for the price and reviews given here. It feels really flimsy, especially the elastic band. The grip even on youth size on my face (adult- and I‚Äôm not even close to skinny) feels like it‚Äôll fall off- which means it doesn‚Äôt grasp the face well and allows air to enter from everywhere.
I‚Äôll keep it since it‚Äôs a hassle to return, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it at all.",Canada,2020-08-26
2,They WERE great. Not so good after the second purchase,"They're so good! I wasn't expecting much because they're just masks but they're comfortable and breathable! There is a waterproof side as mentioned
I got the large size and it fits very well.
I will buy them again :)

Update: I bought them again in the SAME SIZE and it was so much bigger than I previously ordered. This makes me so upset because I bought more of these to replace another mask that was too big and unusable. But now these are also too big and unusable even though I bought the same size as before and they were perfect......I can't even exchange them üò≠",Canada,2020-12-24
2,Too small and turned yellow,"I found the size small was almost too small for my average size 5 year old. If you are looking for masks for kids I would recommend ordering the medium size. After hand washing the mask turned yellow when air dried. Not impressed for the price paid. I was able to find similar, if not better, quality masks at a local store for the fraction of the price. I would recommend only ordering the black in my opinion if you‚Äôre still tempted to purchase these.",Canada,2020-09-17
2,Do not recommend,"I wear glasses, so I had to add a wire to the nose area, otherwise my breath just shot up into my eyes. Once I added the wire to seal the gaps it was a little hard to breathe through, so I won't be using it. Come to think of it, if you're breathing through the gaps beside your nose, not through the fabric, that pretty much defeats the purpose, doesn't it? Unless you're one of the nuts that thinks covid is fake and your purpose is to appear to be breathing through a mask so you don't get hassled at the store, but this isn't going to offer mush protection.",Canada,2020-12-19
2,Very hot and sizing sucks,Doesn‚Äôt fit well at all. Bought the XL size based on the measurements in the add. It‚Äôs way too big and bulges out on the sides. Wish I would have gotten the Large size instead. Comfort and softness is good though. They make my face get hot very quickly though. Don‚Äôt recommend these for all day wear,Canada,2020-11-11
2,Quite expensive... and they shrink,"They are quite expensive for having them shrink after the first wash. Even after following the instructions. So now I have to ""play"" a little bit with the position of the mask to cover from my nose to my chin without getting fog in my glasses. So I would recommend a bigger size so you can get the perfect fit after it shrinks.
Mine are Large... It would've been better with XL.",Canada,2020-08-14
2,Inconsistent size,"I purchased these and were very happy and then purchased a second order, same size. The 2nd order, all 3 masks were different sizes and very large. Even on my husband, who the first order was for, these masks fell off his face. 1 mask fit okay, the other two were bigger",Canada,2020-10-15
2,Fits Large,"Bought the masks in a small for my 5 and 7 year old boys. They said ideal for 3-9. Way too big, the elastics are not adjustable so they can not stay on their faces. They do however fit my face and I wear adult-size masks so I think the fit is really off.",Canada,2020-09-11
2,Stylish but not breathable!,"The style is great. The fit is perfect. However, i returned the product since it is too thick which it is not breathable. You will sweat in the mask. If you wear it for like 5 minutes , it should be fine. Anything longer than that, you will sweat. I wouldnt recommend for workout.",Canada,2020-08-31
2,Not comfortable mask,"Masks are soft and feel good on the face, but not for a long time. The ears attachment pinches in my ears and had to remove. Using only for a 30 min. max. Too much money for this 3 masks. I bought for $12 much more comfortable ones.",Canada,2020-10-26
2,"Soft, but lack of a nose wire causes glasses fogging",These masks are soft and comfortable in the short term as long as you‚Äôre not wearing glasses. Since they lack a nose wire they direct a lot of exhaled air upwards which fogs your lenses. In the long term the material used causes a lot of moisture build up on your face.,Canada,2020-08-18
2,Doesn't stay put!,Within an hour of wearing it loosens and starts slipping. Mask gets pulled down by the chin while talking or chewing gum or any other activity that involves opening Jaws! I wouldn't recommend this product.,Canada,2020-11-24
2,quality and size issues,"Purchased the masks thinking they're higher quality. The earband came off the fabric on first use. They use a cheap elastic-band type attachment. Other masks i've used have a cloth ear band. The ear bands are also small and pull on your ears (even though I ordered a LARGE mask).

Large mask is small... order a size up",Canada,2020-09-14
2,The size is weird.,"I'm a female adult with a small face. I followed the measure guide and my measurement is between 3.75""-4"", so I chose the youth size. But when I get them, they are a little tight for me, and more importantly, the length between bridge and chin is just TOO SHORT and cannot cover my face perfectly while talking. So I need to adjust my mask ALL THE TIME when I wear it at work. It's really annoying and I can't return them either... It's such a waste of money!",Canada,2020-11-25
2,Thick and hot,"I found this mask quite thick and hot to wear. I also wish I had noticed there is no nose wire before purchase. As a result, glasses fog up. I'm still looking for a comfortable mask.",Canada,2020-11-13
2,Strap ripped off immediately...,"I just pulled these out of the package and tried one on for size... Immediately the strap ripped off. I noticed the other part of the strap was barely holding on. These masks are a nice fit and very soft, but obviously they were not sewn very well.",Canada,2020-10-20
2,a heatbag!,"LOved the fit, but that does not override the low comfort level, owing to the buildup of heat in the mask.
I had it on for less than 2 minutes when it became unbearably uncomfortable, because of the heat.",Canada,2020-08-14
2,Poor design,"Very nice masks unfortunately there isn‚Äôt a wire on nose section so it slips down
Constantly. Will be returning. Nice fabric, easy to breathe and good quality. Not a Perfect design.",Canada,2020-09-19
2,Order a size up - It's pricey but not worth the money,I'm a medium size but apparently I have to order a size up due to shrinkage. It also gets hot and humid inside the mask which makes it a bit harder to breathe.,Canada,2020-11-01
2,"No metal nose strips, otherwise comfortable","Comfortable, soft. Wish the ear straps had adjustments. Was noted they had metal nose strips but they don‚Äôt so I rated only 2 stars.",Canada,2020-09-30
2,Selected Medium and order was processed as youth/adult small,Not sure if they are out of MEDIUM but this does not fit a female adult well. Too small!!! When you talk it reveals your nose. Adult LARGE fit me better. The small I got were a waste of money.... My daughters in their 20's also felt it was too small. They are on the petite to normal size people..... too bad because the fabric is good.,Canada,2020-12-10
2,Not contoured like the modeled mask,The models are wearing a heavily contoured mask that looks like it fits well. This is far more square and just ramps off the side of your nose. Fogs my glasses immediately.,Canada,2020-11-16
2,Somewhat overprice,"Got it in a day with Prime delivery. But doesn't feel that impressive when I try it. It's light weight but not sure if it is protective enough. Anyway, I think it is a little overprice",Canada,2020-11-29
2,difficult to breath,This mask is difficult to breath thru. It was sucked onto my face when I put it on. It made me feel running out of breathe.,Canada,2020-11-21
2,Comfortable but lacks nose wire and sizing off,Given the high price I expected a top quailty mask. It does feel comfortable but lacks a nose wire/metal strip so a large space is open between the mask and face near the nose. That defeats the purpose? Maybe a larger size would help but I used the sizing guide.,Canada,2020-09-01
2,Large is too small,Sent these masks back as the large size that was suggested for my size of face doesn‚Äôt adequately cover my nose.,Canada,2020-09-14
2,Not premium in any way,Elastic wears out quickly. Fabric is scratchy on the face. I wear glasses and they fog up easily. It does not have a nose fitting to keep it down. I have s hard time determining the inside from outside. I would not recommend.,Canada,2020-08-29
2,Dont recommend,"Did not like them. They had no wire for nose place. Because of this, the mask kept falling off my nose.",Canada,2020-10-15
2,Very Uncomfortable On The Ears,"The fit is great and the fabric is soft, but the elastic straps have almost no padding and are extremely uncomfortable. They also aren't adjustable in any way, meaning that I can't wear it for more than a couple of hours without pain on the back of both ears.",Canada,2020-08-24
2,Not the best,"Had good coverage, but the ear loops were too long and not adjustable so it was droopy, thus not effective and not returnable.",Canada,2020-11-19
2,If you need xxxl they would be ok,Too stretchy and sags. Too much space at sides. Poor quality straps with no adjustments.,Canada,2020-12-23
2,Mask was nice color.,The mask was a little disappointing as there is no way to insert a filter into it.,Canada,2020-12-03
2,.,The mask itself is a good fit for my face however the elastics are too big making it fit loose. As well the material itself is too thin; you can blow through it. Which makes it unsuitable for most government regulations during COVID.,Canada,2020-11-11
2,Not sure,"This was put on for the first time yesterday when it arrived, and within 60 seconds one of the ear ties/bands broke. It didn‚Äôt stand a chance however it could have been just a rogue one. I‚Äôm not saying anything against the product at all. Thanks.",Canada,2020-09-14
2,Too large!,I followed the measurements and these are way too big,Canada,2020-12-18
2,Wouldn't recommend,"Too slippery to stay in place without a nose grip. While the mask is very breathable and the fit was good, it wouldn't stay in place.",Canada,2020-09-24
2,Very thick,"The fabric used is very thick, good luck breathing through it",Canada,2020-10-07
2,Broke after 2nd use!!! Very disappointed!,Product is soft but string broke after 2nd use!!! Very disappointed since these are quite expensive.,Canada,2020-10-10
2,Bouncy,Bounces around too much whenever I move my chin or speak.,Canada,2020-09-24
2,Masks could be bigger.,"These masks could be bigger from nose to chin, while the shape does make it easier to breathe the lack of length makes the mask fit tight and a bit uncomfortable.",Canada,2020-12-10
2,size chart not good,"I bought a pack of large masks, same size as the regular ones i buy at the drug store.... so if you are a male with a normal size head, don't rely on their size chart.",Canada,2020-12-06
2,String broke within a week of use....,String broke within a week of use....,Canada,2020-11-24
2,Not the best but at least some protection,Hard on ears. Stretch out,Canada,2021-01-18
2,You can see right through it.,It's like wearing a piece of screen.,Canada,2020-09-03
2,not comfortable,When wearing it for more than 15 minutes it felt warm and sweaty under the mask.,Canada,2020-09-01
2,Very week,"It is just a piece of material, very difficult to keep it on the face. If you wear glasses is useless.",Canada,2021-01-22
2,Too loose on the ears,After a few days of wearing them the strings on the ears loosen up and they don't hold well,Canada,2020-12-06
2,Meh,"These are very thin and stretch! After only a few wears this mask was droopy. The look is nice but for the purpose, I would not buy again.",Canada,2020-09-03
2,Poor fit,Sizing was all wrong. We followed measurement instructions but the masks didn‚Äôt fit. The listing says that they‚Äôll help with sizing but don‚Äôt see exchange options anywhere.,Canada,2020-11-24
2,large was too small,"Cannot wear these masks as the elastic hurts the ears ... so tight that my ears were pulled forward and painful ... if I could have returned them, I would have",Canada,2020-11-15
2,Comfort,I like the masks but I bought a size to big. Being i work at a hospital i have to tie a knot in the ear loops for it to fit snug. Otherwise it is a good mask.,Canada,2020-12-24
2,Too big for 5 years old,Too big for 5 years old,Canada,2020-08-01
2,A mask should fit close.,"It is is for men, it is big.",Canada,2020-12-02
2,sizing inconsistant,"I have brought this product at least three times. This time the ""large"" was giganitc! They need to be more consistant with thier sizing.",Canada,2020-12-05
2,Fits Small,"Bought large for my husband and they are way too small, he did say the material is comfortable.",Canada,2020-11-30
2,Poor quality ear loops,The size was as expected but the ear loop elastics on 2 of the items were flabby and unwearable.,Canada,2020-11-11
2,Not worth the money,"Elastics too loose, and hurts the ears when you tie knots in them.",Canada,2020-12-22
2,Soft but sizing is weird,"The mask itself is soft, but after buying for 3 different sizes, none were a good fit at all.",Canada,2020-11-06
2,Pricey,Expensive for what you get...,Canada,2020-09-22
2,Not good for people that wear glasses,"I wear glasses and as soon as I put on one of the masks, my glasses fogged up so these masks are not good for me.",Canada,2020-09-24

2,Too expensive,Not goodbquality,Canada,2020-09-11
2,"not adjustable, too expensive","it is soft but not adjustable, too expensive for this kind of mask. They are hotter than the paper masks.",Canada,2020-08-25
2,Don't buy these,I would not recommend these as they fall part after washing. The ear loop comes off. Worthless.,Canada,2020-12-02
2,Disappointed,These masks do not fit very well and the synthetic material is uncomfortable,Canada,2020-09-04
2,Arrived open and missing a mask,The packet arrived already open and there was a mask missing. Pretty disappointed!,Canada,2020-11-06

2,It fits on me,I like it,Canada,2020-10-04
2,Waste of money,"I was excited for this mask after reading the reviews but I‚Äôm very disappointed with my purchase especially since it‚Äôs a little pricey! These masks DID NOT pass the match test, they had a weird smell (EVEN after washing and air drying), and the sizing was WRONG. I ordered a medium mask and it was not snug on my face. My glasses still kept fogging up. I even tied and knotted the ear loops to make it tighter but no luck. It slips off when I speak or move my mouth. The mask also gets a bit stuffy and feels damp for some reason. Absolutely disappointing and would NOT recommend. Waste of my money.",Canada,2020-08-24
2,Stitching going in 2/3 masks. The other one is awesome. Hence hit or a miss,"Out of 3 masks, 2 of them had threads loose right in the center. It keeps tickling my nose, causing me to either sneeze or scratch it hence defeating the entire purpose of the mask during these times. I'm now using the left over one. Item is non returnable as well. It's a hit or a miss, if you get all 3 with good stitching, the buy is worth it.",Canada,2020-11-15
2,Not so Fitting,"Material is soft but lacks fitting. Took as per the provided size chart, but still is very loose. Only advantage is reusable, but bit costly.",Canada,2020-09-20
2,Was Promising with the Size but fails the mark with the Material used and the fit.,"Poor quality Material. Washed before use, Worn at work this evening Material fraying already.

Size was promising as I need XL at my job PPE is essential and this product doesnt hold up. Size is perfect but is very loose on the face and doesnt give the feeling of Protection.",US,2021-01-25

2,HOT (in a bad way),"So hot!
Product is listed as ""Amazon's choice"" for ""100% cotton XL face mask"".
My fault for trusting Amazon search.
Made of polyester and practically unwearable because it traps the heat from your breath. I don't understand all the positive reviews. My husband also thought it was not larger than his regular sized masks. Not recommended.",US,2020-07-02
2,"Return Customer, Disappointed with Second Purchase","I first purchased this product earlier in the summer because I needed an XL face covering. The black ones I received quickly became my go-to masks. The size is right, they look good, are appropriate for office work, and the hold up well to repeated washing. And as a bonus, though they're multi-layer masks, they fold up small enough to fit in a pocket, so I always have one with me. I ordered three of the blue version this time, and this time I was disappointed. They are, if anything, softer than the black ones, but the ear pieces are less comfortable (haven't yet determined if they're shorter or just more irritating material), they fit more loosely, and perhaps most annoyingly, the middle seam is significantly off-center. This varies by mask. One is close to center, the other more clearly off, and the third way off. Not only do they look wrong, but they pull to one side, and I've caught myself more than once trying to adjust them, so the production error leads to more hand-to-mask contact. I've taken the two out of rotation. The first ones I bought were easy five-star masks. The more recent ones, unfortunately, are not.",US,2020-09-05
2,Too big,I don‚Äôt recommend getting the ‚Äúlargest size with your measurement‚Äù. My measurement was 4.5 inches and the large is way too big so the mask doesn‚Äôt fit around my nose. And no metal strip to form fit to your nose.,US,2020-07-08
2,Not CDC standard safe- Very Disappointed :(,"Masks were disappointing, so close to being great. I thought I had a large sized face, most of the masks I've bought online are always way too small. Ordered these in the XL and they were huge and baggy on my face and my boyfriend's larger face aswell. Not too much of a problem as we could just tie the ear loops smaller to make the mask tight around the face, and that seemed to work. It has good coverage from about under the eye to under your chin. While they are soft, and a good material, they are basically worthless. We did the lighter test to them (where you hold a flame infront of your mask and blow, if the flame doesn't move that means your mask is safe). We didn't even blow that hard and the flame moved around alot, meaning these masks are not very protective. They don't have a filter pocket either so I'm going to have to either make my own filter pocket or wear a surgical mask under it for the protection we need. I'm SO disappointed as the reviews all seemed great- but these masks are not CDC standard safe and was sadly a waste of my money :/",US,2020-08-01
2,Too Small,"I am a large guy but followed the direction for sizing. I was on the upper end of the ""large"" but ordered that given some reviews said the mask was loose even when properly ordered. I measured 5.5 inches and the large was supposed to be OK up to 5.75 inches. The mask did not fit, barely covered my nose and mouth. Clearly would not stay in place. the quality seems good so I ordered the XL and will return these. I will update my review after I get the larger ones.",US,2020-07-17
2,Nice 3 Ply Filtering but Poor Nose Bridge Fitament,"The mask is relatively comfortable and its 3 ply fabric prevents one from blowing out a candle to give an indication of its effectiveness; however, the area around the nose bridge leaves gaps preventing a good ""seal""; there is no metal or plastic to form around your nose bridge (the gap is a serious issue when relying upon this mask in these virus times).",US,2020-07-11
2,"Seems like a perfect fit, but actually not.","So first impressions are it fits great, good material, ear loops not too tight... but then the more I started wearing them, I realized they were kind of unusable at this point because they keep moving down when I'm talking to people and I have to readjust it over my nose CONSTANTLY. I got a size large because I feel like I have a pretty normal male face/head and that was the size recommendation but it just doesn't keep a good level of tightness on the top part so it keeps uncovering my nose. I already washed and wore them, so kinda lost out of the money. So just warning for others, I'm not sure if a smaller size will fix it, but maybe go medium if you're not a giant dude?",US,2020-08-11
2,too big- returning them,"Ordered a large according to the size chart. They were HUGE. Had to return them. Too bad, they look they'd be comfortable",US,2020-07-15
2,Way too big and got snagged on facial hair,"Before purchasing these masks we took measurements as instructed in the item's photos to help us choose the right size. We are two adults - male and female - and the measurements indicated that we would both require size ""large"". Unfortunately they were way too big for us. Not only were they baggy around the face and very loose around the ear straps, the material stuck to my husband's five o'clock shadow and pulled the mask down beneath his nose every time he opened his mouth to speak. Not good.

These masks did seem to be well-made otherwise. Light was not easily visible through them. But if a mask is falling down beneath your nose during a pandemic it's not doing its job. We ended up returning them.",US,2020-07-29
2,Not for the biggest heads,"One thing I've learned from reading all the reviews and using this mask myself is that I must have a HUGE melon. This mask is super soft and comfortable on the face, and it would be great for a guy with a full beard. But, I don't have a full beard; just a big head and big ears to match. The straps pulled my ears forward to make them stick out more. Then, every time I talked or moved my head in the slightest, the mask would slide up my face and into my eyes. So, for protecting you from viruses, it's probably a great mask. But, if you have a HUGE noggin and big ears, and you want to be able to see, this is probably not big enough for you.",US,2021-01-25
2,Very THIN!,"Three ply? Yeah, I dont think so. They are very thin! Doesnt feel like much Rona protection. They look like the cups from a teenage girls bra, lol. Not impressed.",US,2020-09-03
2,"Better masks out there, no seal to prevent glasses from clouding up","I bought this mask to replace masks I bought 6 months ago that are no longer available on AMAZON. I thought that the high ratings would ensure me that the masks would be good quality and at least equivalent to the masks I loved and bought previously.

First off they are soft and rather comfortable enough when when wearing. These are the ""normal"" size. The first design flaw I found was that when you open your mouth to talk or maybe yawn, the mask pulls down and uncovers your nose.

The biggest flaw is probably only for those who wear glasses. Because there is no metal wire seal along the top, which most masks have, your breath is directed up to your eyes, and your glasses fog up. This makes these masks absolutely un-usable for me.",US,2020-10-31
2,Size down if you purchase large,If your face is average and you purchase Large you will not be happy too large around ears and allot of coverage on face. I bought both and I found medium fits best for man and woman/coukld also fit a teenager/would purchase again in medium not large/ was satisfied with the delivery time both times,US,2020-07-25
2,"Fits great, feels good, but had a hole in it on arrival.","Not a huge deal, but the first mask I pulled out straight out of the package had a hole in it, visible from the outside which makes it look like it's old. I normally would try to straighten things out directly with the manufacturer before leaving a review, but AZ made it impossible to do so. This was my only venue to say anything? I have not seen the other 2 in this package of 3 as I gave them away to family members and long gone. As for the size and feel of it, seems to look great and a great fit so far, but I just got it today and was a little disappointed. Seems I've been getting the shaft on everything I buy online anymore and I usually don't complain and just deal with it.",US,2020-07-05
2,Not impressed,"I was getting tired of wearing those disposable masks so I thought I would try these - after reading the reviews on the comfort and sizing I thought I would order the large for my wife and XL for me. I am a big guy, 6'1 - 250lb and the XL is way to big for me - I tried my wifes Large and it fit me well but not so much for her (she's 5'6 140). So why 2 stars - while the sizing knocked it one star the fact everything you breath comes right up your nose to your eyes, there is no bendable wire to form around your nose - I can only imagine if someone wore glasses how annoying that would be. On the plus side they are soft and comfortable.",US,2020-12-03
2,Broke on second use!,"Well, we thought these would be good and we were very optimistic. That changed quick! The first wearing was fine, but after washing and going for a second wear, one of the bands has already broken! Not very happy about that at all. Maybe it's because everyone is freaked out and these are being manufactured at a record rate. Maybe they have always been this fragile! Who knows?!? Won't be getting these again.",US,2020-08-12
2,NOT WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR?,"I consider myself average size, weight etc. Thinking these might run a little small, I ordered an XL. Ok, still too small and non elastic ear straps .
In addition, no nose wire and as a result, putting one on, I could feel air coming in around the top of my nose. I would also assume, as a result, they would fog glasses? Sooo, how good of a job would it do? I sent them back.",US,2020-07-09
2,"Pointless, they have to be washed in cold water and air dry, heat is what kills the virus though..","These look and feel nice, but after reading the laundering instructions, they're pointless. The instructions say to wash in cold water and either air dry or tumble dry on the lowest setting. Well you need heat (hot water or high dryer setting) in order to kill viruses and bacteria the mask collects, that's the only way to clean it. So what are you supposed to do?",US,2020-08-12
2,"Too tight, ear bands hurt behind ears during extended wearing","Looks fine and is soft, BUT anytime I have to wear these more than a few minutes, the tiny elastic bands cut into the area behind my ears. This was very pronounced when I had to wear it 6+ hours during air travel recently. Also, it's very tight to the face and what air does get out, goes straight up into my glasses fogging them up, so just not practical to wear this all day.",US,2020-08-16
2,"Very uncomfortable, itchy mask","The first masks I got were thin and held up fairly well, but after handwashing them multiple times had started to fray.
Looked forward to the masks presuming they would be better.
Not sure why, but they slip on my nose, itch terribly and seem very claustrophobic. I feel like I can't breath as well as I did with my first thinner masks(different seller)and I can't wait to get them off my face when I leave a store.
Would NOT recomend them to anyone.",US,2021-01-01
2,Fabric doesn't breathe,This product is purported to be breathable. It isn't. Within 30 seconds of wearing the mask my glasses are steaming up and that's inside an air conditioned house. Outside they are exceptionally HOT.,US,2020-08-12
2,Keeps riding up into my eyes,"Initially these masks seemed ok. Acceptable for a 10 minute jump inside a store to pick up a few things. But when I wear them longer they quickly ride up into my eyes. The masks don't stay in place when you look down, and eventually they ride up high enough on my face to cover my eyes. Grocery shopping is an experience of constantly pulling the mask down my face to a more comfortable position so the mask top edge doesn't touch my eyeballs. I'll have to shop for replacements.",US,2020-09-13
2,Difficult to breathe,"These masks are soft & stretchy, but they are extremely uncomfortable if you have to wear them for longer than 5 minutes. It's difficult to breathe with them on and I became dizzy, lightheaded & nauseous whilst grocery shopping because I was breathing & re-breathing the same air. Unfortunately, I ordered 2 packs and won't be opening/using the 2nd because they're that unpleasant to use. (Can't return it, either, because I would have to return both, but can't return one of the packages because I opened it)",US,2020-08-07
2,WRONG SIZE,"Looks like a nice produce, but when a ""medium"" is ordered and you receive an ""XL"", it's not any good.
Quanity and Size has become a real issue with Amazon lately. Are we getting too big too fast?

Not all faces are narrow, some are wider.

Even if I cut the inside sides I can't put a filter in because of the seam down the middle. Very thin material, so I don't feel safe wearing these masks.",US,2020-09-03
2,A little better quality needed.,"I followed the instructions on the package which stated to wash them first in cold water prior to using them. I did this and let them air dry. I then took one and looped it over 1 ear but when placing over my other ear the loop broke away from the mask, making it useless. These masks are not the cheap kind so I expected more from them. I will be returning them to Amazon.",US,2020-11-14
2,Hurting my ear,"This mask is not comfortable after wearing 3-4 hours. It starts to hurt my ears. The ear loop is like the one you get on cheap blue mask.
Not recommended if your going to wear all day.",US,2020-12-28
2,Not effective - no nose seal/ formable strip,"You can see light pin points through these.

2,Skip these - try something else,"They are super comfy. BUT, they are cheaply made. No nose part. When I breathe in - the mask sucks in making it hard to wear. I have to pull it down more than I care to, to catch my breath. YES - I know the masks are supposed to be worn tight - that isn't the issue. Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend these to anyone because of that one issue.",US,2020-12-14
2,Would not protect anyone,These were soft and breathable... too breathable! It is mesh like and you can blow straight through them. I blew candles out easily. This is not a good mask for protection from a virus. Also I measured my face and ordered per their size chart and it was huge. They did refund me with no issues so that was nice. Good customer service.,US,2020-12-31
2,Not kid size,"Ok, but definitely not kids size. The small fit me perfectly, but not my 12yr old who needed the masks.",US,2020-07-21
2,very hard to breathe through and too small,"I have a big face and a hard time breathing through masks, was hoping these would help with all the positive reviews, but it was a complete bust. These masks are made of synthetic materials and are very thick, making them very difficult to breathe through. They also aren't much bigger than regular size masks. Completely useless.",US,2020-09-19
2,"Soft, but issues with ear straps","Not all that breathable, but I suppose thats okay given the reason we are wearing them. My biggest complaint is definitely the ear straps. They are thin elastic that is comfortable, but loading its stretch after a few times wearing one of these. So not very durable and will to order something to replace these already.",US,2020-12-18
2,Not very effective for a few reasons...,"The mask's material seems durable and is comfortable/light enough to wear for extended periods of time. However, there is no malleable piece of metal near the nose to provide a secure fit and the large sizing leaves the mask loose on my face (it wont fit my wife's face at all). The ear straps are not adjustable, either. My wife purchased a different 3-mask set from American Eagle for significantly less money and each mask is adjustable, providing a snug fit around the nose. These masks will only work for those who need larger sizes; I'm 6'1"" and incorrectly assumed the large sizing would be fine for me. I'd recommend finding masks that are adjustable and more form fitting.",US,2020-08-13
2,Beware Size!,"I purchased the smallest size of this mask for my kids ages 4 to 12. The bands that go aroudn the ears barely fit tight enough around my 12 year old. My other kids cannot wear these as they do not stay on. The cloth is nice, and they seem decent in quality, but the size is compeltely inaccurate due to the ear bands.",US,2020-08-21
2,Earbands too tight and not made well! Hurts back of my ears,Was hoping I was going to like these. I got the large. I'm average size adult male. The face mask itself is good nice and soft material. Good to breath in. Then there is the problem with the earbands. There too tight and not made out of soft material. Kinda like a rough hair tie. These would have been good if earbands were adjustable or loose and made out of soft material. I thought about maybe if I went xl size might not be as tight. But still not happy with the earbands how there made hurts back of my ears. Going in the trash as I will find better ones.,US,2020-09-20
2,No metal over the bridge of your nose,"You need that little piece of bendable metal over the bridge of the nose to keep a mask in place and so you can squeeze the mask against your face to keep your glasses from fogging. These don't have that. I have found they are okay for a short visit to a store for COVID protection, but they slip off the face when worn for longer periods of time. Otherwise they are comfortable and thick, so no complaints. It's just that there are plenty of cheap options with the metal piece, don't bother with these.",US,2020-12-24
2,They are going back,"Since this item is shown with the additional filters one would assume they work together. Not so.

Why would they be shown together on both ads .... the mask and filter pages recommend buying together.",US,2020-07-29
2,Far too small for an adult,"As an adult with an average-sized, perhaps even smaller-leaning, head, these are WAY too small. The mask itself is a bit too small, but the strings that attach behind your ears are so tiny they will barely fit over even when stretched. Because of how tight it is with these tiny strings, it's very uncomfortable to wear. I will not be using these masks and I regret my purchase.",US,2020-11-10
2,Do not wash it...,"I washed mine using warm soap and water and now it doesn't fit any longer, it shrank to the point where I have to really pull hard to get it to go around my ears. They are comfortable and stylish until you wash them, then useless, at least for me.",US,2021-01-12
2,Wonky fit,"The large size was too big for me (and my face is average size). I had to knot the ear loops to adapt the fit, which still hasn‚Äôt completely resolved the issue (now the knots dig into my ear/head). The biggest problem for me is the lack of a nose grip; I can‚Äôt wear my glasses as they completely fog up. Now I have to invest in more masks and they‚Äôre not cheap. I purchased this product based on the great reviews. Very disappointed.",US,2021-01-14
2,Strap broke on first mask I put on,"The masks are nice and comfortable, but the very first mask that I pulled out and put on, the right ear strap broke. And it wasn't like I wasn't stretching it far or anything, just putting it on. But it was instantly useless. The other two seem great, but what a bummer to pay for three and really only get two. I hope others have better luck.",US,2020-12-30
2,Very thin offers little to no protection from virus.,"For covid 19 protection these are useless, they can‚Äôt even pass the candle test. WAY too much air passes through these. Other than that the fit is great and they‚Äôre a very soft material. I‚Äôll put these aside for outside grass cutting duty but forget it for anything else.",US,2020-09-26
2,Doesn't seal around the nose,"It is comfortable and seems to be well made, but it does not seal around my nose. I end up with fog in my glasses and I'm not sure it fulfills its purpose with so much air flow around the nose. I'm sure I will be able to fix it by running a thin piece of wire in the trim so I can shape it, but it would have been nice if it were fully functional as is.",US,2020-10-21
2,Too big for kids,"Definitely didn't fit my 6 year old, but fits my adult face. Two stars because I will wear them, but annoyed that I have to keep searching for masks that fit my kid.",US,2020-08-07
2,Too big for a small adult face. Definitely not ‚Äúyouth size‚Äù.,"I ordered the youth/adult small masks, but they were entirely too big for my face. I gave them to my fianc√© and they fit him fine.",US,2020-07-19
2,Ineffective against Covid due to gaps around the nose!,"There is only one reason why I gave this mask a 2-star rating. That is it doesn't block the air, when you breath, from coming in from both sides of your nose, due to the gaps. The gaps are there because the mask doesn't have a flexible metal strip to clamp down on your nose. It was a well made mask, comfortable, and covered my face very well, except for this one design flaw. If the manufacturer adds a metal strip to future masks, then I'd give it a 5-star rating. Until then, I get better protection from my disposable face mask.",US,2021-01-29
2,Doesn't fit my nose snugly,"Doesn't provide much protection along the sides of my nose, even though the mask fits snugly enough around the mouth‚Äîit needs a wire nose-piece so that the fabric doesn't leave gaps between the nose and the cheeks. It is reasonably comfortable, although adjustable ear loops would be helpful because the tension is a bit too high for me. Size Large‚Äîany smaller would be too tight. I would've rather had one mask that fit well than three that don't...would be good if company sold these as individual masks to avoid waste (I didn't see them available in singles).",US,2020-09-02
2,Ear loops aren‚Äôt for childrens sizes,I ordered these for my son who‚Äôs 9. 1 came with one of the ear loops unattached. Of course I couldn‚Äôt just return 1 but needed the other 2 for school so that was a small loss. The cloth is ‚Äúchild sized‚Äù but the ear loops are big on him still for being a size small so I had to tie little knots so they would fit better but that‚Äôs ok they‚Äôll make due until I receive different ones.,US,2020-09-07
2,Frustrated by Shrinkage and Size Issues,"Two sizes were purchased by my wife. The large was too loose even after washing and the medium shrunk up in length/height after trying it on and washing before wearing. (Of course, they are both too small for me.) Sadly, we wasted our money on two different orders/sizes. My wife is frustrated, to say the least as it is back to the search for a mask that fits. I don't know if these would protect anyway. They're pretty thin feeling and I don't feel three fabrics.",US,2020-11-14
2,Disappointed,Was excited to receive but was sorely disappointed. The adult size masks are VERY large which means there is no stretch as claimed because they are way to big! I do not have a small face either. Probably only useful for wearing over an N95.,US,2020-07-26
2,Ears hurt,"I really liked it initially but when I use it after several washes, my ear started to hurt. The elastic of ear loop may shrunk, but I no longer able to use. The texture is soft, shape is ideal but I cannot wear anymore.",US,2020-12-11
2,Not XL.,"I purchased these for my husband. He needs a larger size face mask. I was excited when I saw the description. Once I received the order, I realized they aren‚Äôt much larger than the regular size I already had.",US,2020-06-30
2,Deteriorated when washed!,"Loved these masks and thought they were protecting me but it turns out after a few machine washes, over the course of only a few weeks, these masks fail the match test! I don‚Äôt know if washing the masks deteriorated the functionality of the masks but I was very disappointed. When I first bought the masks I tried the match test, it worked and felt very safe but now not so much, they feel thinner as well.",US,2020-10-19
2,WAY too big,"These are soft, comfortable, and breathable. However, they are WAY too big for my average sized 12 year old and 10 year old. They fit me, and I am a full-grown adult. Not sure how these are marketed for kids ages 4-10. Bummer.",US,2020-07-20
2,Won‚Äôt stay over nose. I would not buy again.,"Bought for my 5 year old. It‚Äôs so soft that it won‚Äôt stay up. Because it has no nose wire or hold up mechanism, it falls down easily. I‚Äôve tried tightening ear loops and even doubling up with a disposable mask with nose wire and the disposable stays up, this one falls down. I can‚Äôt use to send him to school anymore because of this. For your product improvement - include a nose wire inside fabric, ear loop adjusters and possibly stronger fabric to ensure a better fit for kids.",US,2021-01-28
2,Like a wool sock over your face,So soft and comfortable BUT absolutely unbreathable. I'm only able to wear these for a VERY short time before the lack of air makes me feel like I'm going to hyperventilate. Maybe in winter they will be better.,US,2020-12-08
2,No nose wire and quite warm,I like the fit but there is no nose wire therefore my glasses fog up...alot. The material has polyester which I find rather warm. After a while of wearing my mask it feels damp.,US,2021-01-14
2,Great comfort but not sure if COVID-safe,"I bought these masks before traveling across a few states over a long drive. While these masks are really soft and comfortable, there's a gap between the mask and my nose trench that makes them loose and I am not sure if they are as protective.",US,2020-08-02
2,Way Too Thin For Covid Protection,These mask are really comfortable and fit well but they are waaaay too thin to be of any significant protection against germs. Even with 3 layers. I am able to feel my breath if I blow through the fabric. I know the description says non surgical but since it seemed such a popular purchase on Amazon I figure many people are buying it for protection against the virus. Too bad it doesn't have a pocket for some kind of filter.,US,2020-09-06
2,Not impressed,I am not impressed with this product. I bought a medium size and it is too big. The directions stated to wash in cold water and let it air dry. I don‚Äôt understand how you can sterilize the mask in cold water. I washed it in warm water and put it in the dryer under low heat. It shrank a little which was good but it still is not snug on my face. I will be washing it in hot water and see what happens.,US,2021-01-23
2,Three ply is too thick,They are large so they fit but if you want to breathe do not put it on it is too thick to breathe through. I am wearing a mask because I have to but I also have to breathe the three ply is too thick. I will order something else. It‚Äôs my fault,US,2020-07-29
2,BEWARE OF SIZE,"The product was super comfortable and the material seemed to be of high quality. However, the size was far too small. I order the large one, and it barely covered my chin. I'm an average sized male with an average sized head, I would recommend to get the extra large one. Tis, a shame that it did not fit.",US,2020-07-17
2,Huge,"I have a small face - however these are huge - way too big. Also, I was expecting them to have a slit to insert a filter for more protection - it does not have this. No wire in the nose - so it gapes too much for me to wear",US,2020-08-06
2,Save your money!,"Even though the size was supposed to be correct, it was too small to even cover my nose. They slipped off every time I spoke! Total junk. I trashed them!",US,2020-11-02
2,Straps are tearing in the first hour of wearing!,"Great fit, material of the mask is awesome, but the elastic is nill. I just arrived at work and the elastic is already pulling apart from the mask. I wish they would of put more attention into the durability of this. I wouldn't think that anybody is going to get any kind of longevity out of these.",US,2020-08-03
2,Broke strap after a couple weeks,"A little disappointed as after only a couple weeks one of the ear straps broke. Comfortable bought not worth the cost if all three break after minimal use, as I don‚Äôt go about much.",US,2020-08-16
2,"No nose clip, to keep it tight","The mask is very comfortable, I just wish there was a nose ring that helps it keep tight. I feel like it wouldn't work against covid even though I know mask are not 100% safety, it just feels to thin and feel like the virus can pass through",US,2021-01-07
2,Reorder was different from the original product.,"I‚Äôm very confused about my 2 orders for these. The masks sent were not the same. The first order I received was great, it has a perfect shape for the kids. The 2nd order was a different mask with a white backing and is not the best fitter. I‚Äôm really disappointed that I spent the money on the second order and it ended up being an inferior product.
They were supposed to be the same!",US,2020-12-16
2,Not suited as a covid-19 mask.,I would not purchase this if you're looking for a mask to protect you from Covid. While it is comfortable there's no wire to mold the top of the mask to your nose to ensure a tight seal. And overall the mask is somehow both too big and too small all at once.,US,2020-11-11
2,Not good,This mask is ok. It doesnt have the adjustable meral piece that goes above the nose. Fabric is soft but feels too thick.,US,2021-01-02
2,Too hot for summer & sizing chart is off,"The sizing chart and instruction is wrong. I followed it and purchased the XL size which was too large. If you‚Äôre on the upper end of the scale go down, not up. The mask is way too hot and itchy to wear in summer weather. I could not wear this mask on warm to hot days. Would sweat too much under this mask. May be good in winter weather. Lastly, don‚Äôt wash in washing machine with other clothes. Color bled on to other clothes.",US,2020-08-22
2,I have been cheated,I was supposed to get two in the package I only received one (3 in pouch) I need the other three as I paid for them,US,2020-10-30
2,Didn't Last,"I work in a pharmacy so I talk a lot (stretching the mask), but the mask is also really important. After 2-3 days of use they began falling down my face making them nothing more than a liability. Basically $20 for a week of use. Not at all worth it. These are okay for trips to the store with minimal talking, but not anything else.",US,2020-10-29
2,Not So Great,"I'm 6 ft. and weigh 200 lb. I ordered a large, but apparently I have a big head because it pulls my ears out and is uncomfortable. Also, it is less breathable than the common paper masks.",US,2020-11-26
2,Way to big...,"If you have a head Big as Texas, you might like the mask. I have a big head and it still fell off. The mask must be made for animals....a cow, pig, moose, not a human...",US,2020-10-10
2,If you like foggy glasses,Yes lightweight but without the metal piece the mask does not contour to your nose allowing heat to escape and fogging glasses. Useless to me since my glasses constantly fog.,US,2020-09-15
2,Not good for physical activity/working out,I bought this to use in the gym but it did not workout. If you plan on doing any physical activity the mask will get suck into your airway when breathing heavy....I guess it‚Äôs good for an everyday use though,US,2020-10-26
2,Fair,A little flimsy,US,2020-07-31
2,Its not that big fellas!,"Mask feels short and like the ear loops are pulling my ears in. Good softness and material, but I need a mask that will fit me. Good mask for small heads, but not for big people.",US,2020-08-31
2,Disappointed,Doesn't fit tightly over the nose. Large size is smaller than expected. Would not feel safe in it.,US,2020-07-10
2,Do not buy if you wear glasses,"Masks will not work with glasses, the material is too loose and the glasses fog badly. I've tried several types of masks and these were the worst.",US,2020-08-21
2,Ear loops too big for my 7 year old,Purchased the small/kids size. Sizing runs very big. Ear loops were waaaaay too big for my 7 year old.,US,2020-09-06
2,They have a bad smell,Ordered 2 packages of these masks. They all have a strange smell. It took a lot of Febreze to get rid of it. Ugh.,US,2020-09-06
2,3 Ply?,"I don't see that they are three layers, and they are overpriced for the quality. Comfortable enough for extended wear.",US,2020-07-12
2,Mask is not good for exercising,"This mask is not good for the gym if you are on a treadmill. It is polyester and cotton. It gets wet after you work out. I don't find it that comfortable. It is okay if you go into a store or restaurant, but for activities indoor and outdoor I don't recommend it.",US,2020-10-19
2,Did not work for my husband.,"My husband needed a bigger size and these are right size for him, but the mask kept coming up when he talked.",US,2020-07-30
2,Not what I expected,These mask are pretty small. I haven't seen any mask that are able to fit heavy set people like myself.,US,2020-09-03
2,Fogged Glasses,"If you wear glasses, as I do, I would suggest looking for another mask option. While they are comfortable and breathable, the lack of structure around the nose area leads to constantly fogged glasses.",US,2020-12-11
2,Too big for my 3 year old.,"Too big for my 3 year old. I ordered appropriate size, so disappointed as I really needed it to fit my son.",US,2020-07-07
2,Broken ear loop.,"- i purchased these masks on 8/30. When i opened the bag, the ear loop of one mask was already broken (see picture attached). Clearly, the manufacturer does not have the minimum quality control/inspection.

- I rarely put negative comments on any products. I am so disappointed by the quality this time.",US,2020-09-05
2,go smaller with the size,"Based on their sizing, I ordered large, and it fit just fine in the beginning; however, after a couple uses, they stretched a bit and now they keep falling off my nose. Everything else is great though. So if you're gonna order, I'd say go a size smaller than what they suggest",US,2020-09-27
2,One snapped the second I tried to put it on,I just opened the box and tried one on for the first time just to see if they fit my face. Then one of the ear loops snapped as soon as I tried to put it on. I'm down one mask now. Overall though they are pretty comfortable and fit really well on my face.,US,2020-12-11
2,Not very breathable facemasks,"These facemasks are loose, baggy and have no nose bridge wire to stop fogging on the eyeglasses. Soft materials but not very breathable.",US,2020-08-11
2,You can see right through these,"The fabric stitch is so thin, if you hold is up to the light you can see right through them",US,2021-02-02
2,Check the quantity,"Only got 2 not 3. A bit sad. Love them, third time ordering.",US,2021-01-21
2,"Will fog up your glasses, are very large","These masks were very large and do not provide a good fit, especially if you have glasses. I feel like I am sucking in the material every time I try to talk in these. My co-worker gave me a different mask that fits much better. Can not attest to their durability as I try to wear this particular mask as little as possible (only when others are in the wash)",US,2020-08-26
2,Not the best,Really loose around nose and face. Any cough or sneeze is going up and out. Comfortable and sized correctly.,US,2021-01-23
2,Slips below nose,"I bought these for my 8 and 10 year old. The mask is soft but it kept slipping down below their nose when they would talk in school. I was so happy to finally find a mask that fit my kids. Needless to say, I was disappointed. üòû",US,2020-11-04
2,Elastic straps,"The fabric part is the perfect size its soft and breathable but it seems like they can't get the strap size to all match, all of my masks in the 3 pack had different lengths and can only use 1 out of the 3 masks bc of it.",US,2020-12-05
2,Not for people who wear glasses,"Without a nose wire, this is impossible to wear with glasses. They just end up fogged up all the time.",US,2020-12-17
2,It's not as large as XL would suffest.,I am very disappointed in the XL size for men. When I open my to breath it slips down a bit on my nose. Maybe this would work for normal size men. It seems soft and decent quality otherwise.,US,2020-07-24
2,It‚Äôs all about the size.,"Seems like decent quality however order a size larger than you need if you use the sellers measurement tool. Unfortunately these do not fit me and I hate doing returns, I‚Äôll have to give them to a small adult or child.",US,2020-08-20
2,Does not stay in place,Does not stay in place despite the multiple size options.,US,2020-11-08
2,Do not fit,These are terrible. I went by the measurements and they do not fit at all.,US,2020-07-23
2,I‚Äôm confused,"It‚Äôs all good till I washed it, after wash it seems like it‚Äôs not water resistant anymore.",US,2020-10-12
2,As advertise the Face masks are made of cotton and the elastic is Thin,The masks are made out of cotton. It has two layers. The elastic is thin.,US,2020-07-24
2,Too big,"Followed the measurement guidelines, but large was still way to big for my face (adult female). Not usable. Husband will try them out. Mask does not tuck under the chin as much as it should for secure fit and good coverage.",US,2020-09-29
2,Hot,"Fit ok, but they don't breathe very well and it gets hot.",US,2020-08-29
2,Ok. But needs work.,Purchase the product because we have to wear masks. So i figured why not try this one. Got the package and opened it up and try one on to see the fitment and then the strap broke. The straps need to be one full piece and stitched all the way. From one side to the other. Instead of one stich on the ends. But over all soft product.,US,2020-07-21
2,"Looked like quality masks, but small","Didn‚Äôt open sealed package. Masks appeared and felt light weight, nice material, good quality ear straps. Good for youth and maybe a petite woman. Too small for husband. Returned.",US,2020-12-17
2,Non comfortable,Fogged up my glasses.,US,2020-12-16
2,Too small,"These are for very young kids and babies, not youth.",US,2020-07-25

2,fat faces only,if you have a large mug this is for you,US,2020-09-10
2,Not for people with glasses,NOT FOR GLASSES WEARERS. Fogs up my glasses with every breath.,US,2020-09-18
2,Not a good fit.,Did not like the way it was presented.,US,2020-09-05
2,Would be perfect.... if it was adjustable.,These masks would be 5 stars all day if the war loops were adjustable. They are made of thin round elastic that slightly cuts into the back of the ears making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.,US,2020-10-16
2,this mask keeps falling off the nose,i don't use this product,US,2020-12-06
2,Will not purchase again.,Mask came damaged.,US,2021-02-02
2,Didn't meet expectations.,Too large and didn't fit comfortably.,US,2020-10-06
2,Ok but sloppy sewing and very hot,"Ok mask for a pinch. Very hot with the 3-ply mask and some of the seems are coming apart already after 1 washing. Not very breathable, especially for the summer weather. Recommend a 2-ply mask for use if you are going to wear your mask for any length of time (over 15 minutes).",US,2020-08-16
2,Sizing inconsistent,I‚Äôve purchased quite a few and my last batch of 9 orders came in drastically different sizes. I cannot return them as they were purchased for HTV project.,US,2020-10-22
2,Not the greatest,Not very satisfied with purchase.,US,2020-10-01
2,Not breathable at all!,This feels like you have 3 layers of underwear on your face. Within 5 minutes there was sweat dripping and it because very hot to wear.,US,2020-08-03
2,3 pack came with only 2,"Great mask, very comfortable but paid and ordered the 3 pack but instead got only 2 mask on the package. Otherwise would give 5 stars",US,2020-08-25
2,Paint run off,Washed it and paint ran off.,US,2020-07-13
2,Bad fit,The product lookd great and is of quality materials but the ear straps are too long so it hangs on a child‚Äôs face. They should be shorter to ensure an accurate fit.,US,2020-08-04
2,This product not for those who wear glasses,I should have done my homework. Their is not a reinforced area across the bridge of the nose to seal the area. With every exhale you get a momentary fogging of your glasses. The cheap disposal masks have this. Obviously disappointed. The masks are now in my pile of last resort items.,US,2020-09-30
2,Size does not meet description.,Package marked XL but masks are not marked with size. They are more like Medium in size not XL They do not cover a mans face at nose and chin. Should have ordered Made in USA but this was a recommended product by Amazon. I see they are made in Vietnam. Not worth the price for skimpy cotton masks.,US,2020-09-07
2,Potential Fit Issue,Used fit suggestions manufacturer provided and the masks are very loose and fall off my nose.,US,2020-07-28
2,"Comfortable, but dont last long","Comfortable, but the ear loops break with little use",US,2020-11-07
2,Not breathable,Hard to breath through it.,US,2020-11-29

2,Notnfor thosenof who wear glasses!,I wear glasses and with this mask my glasses fog up worse than with any other mask. Don't recommend for glass wearersüò£,US,2020-10-02
2,Its comfortable... but,"It is comfortable mask, but it collects a lot of lint when washing them. It also itches your mouth area a lot because of the lints, which is a bit annoying when using it. Otherwise, it does the job.",US,2020-10-01
2,Too big,I ordered these for my 3 1/2 year old and they are way too big. They are also too loose for my 6 year old. It can actually fit pretty comfortably on my face. Theybalso had a weird chemical smell to them.,US,2020-07-29
2,Do not waste your money.,Tiny and not worth the $$s.,US,2020-08-30
2,Not breathable,The mask itself is well constructed but the fabric is not breathable and hot. All three layers are 65% polyester which shouldn‚Äôt be used on a face mask. The mask was so hot I could not wear it all day at work and had to change to a disposable mask.,US,2020-11-10
2,Not secure fit,"I really wanted to be happy with these, but they really don‚Äôt offer much protection. I was going to try to modify, but think I‚Äôll probably just end up returning these.",US,2020-07-19
2,Needs a nose grip.,Good size. But...will NOT stay up over your nose. Needs wire like other masks.,US,2020-11-19
2,Do not recommend fits tight on ears,Fits really tight and hard to stay around ears,US,2020-09-05
2,Not the product it used to be a few months ago,Bought these the first time and loved them. Ordered more and they were completely different. They are smaller and the straps are made of a scratchy elastic.,US,2021-01-05
2,"Poor Quality, Ear Straps broke immediately","One of the three masks broke immediately at the ear loop as soon as I went to put it on. Effectively paid for two masks, not three. Now nervous the other two will do the same. Overall poor quality.",US,2021-01-25
2,Don't stay up above nose,Not so great. They don't stay up. I have tried both sides. Ordered large size 190 lb 5-11.,US,2020-10-12
2,Quality was poor,The first one I started to use the earpiece broke off and then as I went to the other one and I found it to smell badly so I put them all back in the package I found them to be rather cheap especially the ear holders,US,2020-12-12
2,Sweat box with straps,These things are 3 layers thick. Not easily breathable at all. You start sweating inside as soon as you put it on. I‚Äôm taking a razor blade and cutting the inner two layers out to see if that makes these things breathe easier.,US,2020-09-17
2,"Didn't fit, too big!","I had high hopes due to how popular these are, and after reading the reviews and comments ordered size large. Nope! Do NOT order size large if you have a normal/average sized adult face. Falls right off. Wasted my money.",US,2020-09-15
2,Not adjustable. One size only and a little small for a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù person,"One size. Not XL. Im 6,2 230. Maybe I‚Äôm XXL but this is not adjustable.",US,2021-02-05
2,Sizing is wrong,"I used the size chart, came up with XL, wrong, should have been L, can‚Äôt return, for some reason they are also very hot",US,2020-12-29
2,Very Thin Material,These masks are not as good as the disposable surgical masks. Lots of tiny holes and better than nothing. I cannot see how this would provide much protection to anyone.,US,2020-12-12
2,Comfort but not durable,Husband said he loved the way they feel on his face when he is working all day. But disappointed after only 2 wears one of them started to tear at the seams. That is why only 2 stars.,US,2021-01-02
2,Extremely warm,The mask is comfortable to wear but extremely warm. Wore for half an hour in an air conditioned store and the inside was wet from sweat/condensation.,US,2020-08-06

2,Loose,"Feel very loose, its useless to protect urself.",US,2020-08-08
2,Ear straps way too big,Bought these for my kids to start school. I got a youth small for my 8 year old. The mask fit perfect but the straps are way too big. I bought the medium for my 13 year old and same thing. Ear straps are too loose.,US,2020-08-08
2,Very hot to wear,I purchased this because it was advertised as being cool to wear. I found it to be much hotter and harder to breath in than any other mask that I own,US,2020-08-24
2,The size is most important. If it doesn‚Äôt fit they are of no use.,I received three different sizes. The masked would be fine except only one fits. I even put them in the dryer hoping they would draw up but they didn‚Äôt. Very disappointed I the sizes. The mask itself seems fine haven‚Äôt worn either ione.,US,2020-08-10
2,Elastic Broke First Time Worn,"These XL masks fit well and were soft and comfortable. However, the first time one of them was worn, the elastic snapped. The elastic is very thin. Very disappointed as good XL size masks are hard to find.",US,2020-08-17
2,This mask is SO hot,I can‚Äôt believe this mask has such good reviews. It‚Äôs so hot it feels like I‚Äôm wearing fleece on my face. Soft but not worth it.,US,2020-10-21
2,Not breathable,"Definitely not good to wear while working, working out or any type of activity. It gets very hot and out of breath easily causing me to pull mask away from face. Would not buy again. They are soft, only plus.",US,2020-11-01

2,Ehhhh,Definitely did not my fit my three (3) year old. I bought because now every store requires masks to go in and pick up/deliveries for food are weeks away. They definitely fit the higher end of youth age kids,US,2020-07-20
2,very thin,"It says 3-ply feels more like 1 ply..not thick at all..Very thin, will still have to wear blue mask under it...Very disappointing..Good covereage over face, good stretch but thin",US,2020-08-15
2,Broke after 1 wear,"The stitching holding the ear piece loop broke the first time I took it off my face. I didn't rip it off my head, I took one ear off then pulled at the other and the loop broke at the stitching. Will not buy again.",US,2020-08-27

2,Huge size Inconsistencies bad quality control,"I deleted my old review and had to knock this product down to two stars. I've bought 2 bags if youth/m for myself and 2 bags of large for my husband different times over the period of a few months. One bag of large only had one working mask because the ear elastics on the others were broken, the second bag of large came with all ear elastics intact but the masks were smaller than our first pack of large.... moving on to youth/Medium: the first bag of medium fit well on me and there were no issue, the second pack of mediums came with one medium and the other two were the same size as our larges. Order at your own risk. The quality control and sizing is clearly extremely inconsistent.",US,2020-07-29
2,Sits funny,"These don't fit youth, I am an adult female and they don't even fit me that well. They are made at an odd angle that if you talk or move it instantly slide off your nose.

In my picture, it shows where it was to default to sit at, below the nose which makes it not effective.

I wanted this for my son, but it is too big for him. And these sit funny so probably won't use",US,2020-07-01
2,Bonne qualit√© mais trop grand,"Ils sont confortables et on l‚Äôair d‚Äô√™tre de bonne fabrication, mais ils sont trop grands, il faut constamment le remettre a sa place. Dommage.",France,2021-01-19
2,"Good comfortable XL fit, everything else is bad","The XL size gets Five stars for fit, but everything else is a one star. I‚Äôm a big guy. 6‚Äô3‚Äù tall, 250 pounds and many masks are simply too small to comfortably cover my mouth and nose at the same time. These do that well, BUT after that everything else goes downhill. I‚Äôm also a retired emergency physician, and wore medical masks frequently for many years. These masks do not have the metal strip at the top that seals around your nose, which causes fogging of my glasses, and more importantly leaves a gap where virus contaminated air can bypass the mask. Plus other reviewers have said they can breathe easily though this mask, and that‚Äôs true. But that makes me wonder how good of a virus barrier these are. If the air goes through too easily, the the virus might too. I won‚Äôt be wearing these masks.",US,2020-12-11
2,Difficult to speak with theses on.,"Great mask, great price! You can actually breathe through them. They are light weight and cover your nose and mouth well. I have a small face, but my husband and son are big guys and the mask stretch to fit them. Straps seem to be very secure on these mask.
EDIT: after wearing one of theses mask for about 30 mins. I discovered it is very difficult to speak with them on and because they don‚Äôt have the wire nose piece It moves constantly when you speak. I would recommend purchasing a mass with a nose wire.",US,2020-06-22
2,"Poorly made, ear loops broke","I was very happy to get these masks based on the wonderful reviews. When i opened them there was a bit of a smell, but that was fine since the instructions were to wash first. I hand washed one mask and after letting it dry let it become my car mask. It lived happily in may car hanging from the turnsignal. I would put it on to go into stores and then remove it. Prior to this I was using a good disposable (one of the ones made prior to corona that dont hurt my ears and smash my nose). Those would last for a very long time until I would finally become disgusted with them. This barely lasted.

I was heading into Costco a few days ago and just putting the mask on I had the ear loop dethatch from the mask. It was an uncomfortable experience having to jerry rig this to stay on my face and keep me in compliance. This had never been machine washed or mistreated or abused. It had only been used by me and didnt log a lot of wearing cycles or hours. I am grateful for Amazon's generous return policy.",US,2020-11-11
2,Disappointed,"I searched for an hour reading reviews before finally settling on this mask. We did the measurements and ordered a set in size large for my husband and a medium/youth for myself. At first I was very impressed. The mask was soft, comfortable and I could actually breathe, but I have a small, narrow face and the size was just still too large for me. So before opening the package for my husband, I had him try on the smaller size. Fit quite well, but I thought looked a tad too small. I opened the large package and the results: both sizes fit the same and somehow I actually got the
6 masks intermingled and needed to sort them appropriately. There were NO size markings and lying them together I saw they were all about the same size! No difference at all! What a waste of time. Returned them and now am hesitant to buy another brand. Really frustrating.",US,2021-01-08
2,Shame on me.... Inner Layer NanoFine Cotton Blend?!?,"I can see clearly now as the dropplets come...I'm embarrassed...I read the ""Nanofine"" in the description, and all the glowing reviews, without doing my research into ""nanofine"", well, its nothing more than a ""folded bandana"". I really desperately wanted to love these as a replacement for the wasteful surgical masks, but, I CAN SEE LIGHT THRU THESE ?!?!? I admit, I haven't washed them yet, so they may tighten-up, but ATM, I am very skeptical of trusting them to protect my family. Should have just bought some local, from neighbors who also incorporate PM2.5 pockets...Ima soooo ashamed....",US,2020-07-17
2,Inconsistent sizes!,"These are ok. I ordered a large for my husbands rugged face. However, the ones that came are not the same sizes. I'm not too upset because I can use the smaller ones. But it would have been nice to get what I ordered.",US,2020-07-14
2,The XL isn't big enough for my husband's head,"I had purchased Large for me and XL for my husband. Others folks descriptions made me believe that they would fit a large head with a beard. My husband couldn't stretch the loops far enough to get them over his ears. When I compare the two sizes, they were basically the same size. The fabric masks make it a little too difficult to breathe while wearing. The paper masks are much easier to breathe through. I will probably use these only when I plan very short term use, like 10 minutes or less. Am going to order a box of 50 papers masks.",US,2020-11-30
2,What's with the blue?,"I have ordered the black version of these twice and have been very satisfied. Then I decided to try the blue in the exact same size large. They were much bigger, baggy and oddly cut. They round out in the front too far making you look like you have on a horse feeder bag. While I realize wearing a mask isn't really a fashion statement, they should fit properly and look decent. My other ones(black) were not cut in the same way. They are rounded in the front as well but not as much proving a nice contour fit. What's up with that? My advice is: Stick with the black. The blue ones are weird and big. I returned them.",US,2021-01-23
2,Breathable but so is gauze,"Measured against my wife's homemade, 3 ply cotton with nose clip these just aren't competitive. I thought that homemade might not be good enough so bought these since they were very highly rated - as we learn this doesn't always mean that much given that most people will rate anything that doesn't fall apart immediately as at least four stars.
In any case, these masks are two ply without a pocket to fit a filter. Two ply makes them very breathable but then so is gauze. The knit makes them comfortable. However, they are hot and slip down since there is no nose clip and they fog up glasses as well. I threw them in my glove compartment in case I forget my homemade mask.",US,2020-09-09
2,Not protective,"I blew a candle out wearing this mask; while washing it, water quickly seeped & went through it; no nose wire to keep potential airborne virus out; sewn right down the middle, so no PM2.5 filter can be inserted and no full face filter can be worn comfortably, paper-thin double-ply stretchy fabrics, not 100% cotton. I should have searched the reviews carefully for descriptive info, if you want CDC reco‚Äôd strength & protection more than super soft and cute fashion, these are not for you.",US,2021-01-01
2,They changed the sizing - WAY too big - XXXL?,"Update: after ordering these three times and loving them they have totally changed the sizing! They are now WAY too big for my face and don‚Äôt fit at all. I‚Äôm not sure why they would do this after months and months of offering a consistently good product. I won‚Äôt order them again.

Old review:
I‚Äôve tried 11 different brands and this is the coolest feeling and largest fit I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù 250 and these fit great (there‚Äôs still room to stretch for bigger faces). The two layers are thick but somehow not hot - every other mask made my face sweat. I ordered another pack right away.",US,2020-07-24
2,Soft but for me MUCH TO HOT for all day wear,"I have to wear a mask all dat at work. These are very soft which I love and all black so my makeup transfer is hidden BUT they hold A LOT of heat. I had to switch to a different mask 1/2 way through the day.
I‚Äôd say great for short runs to grocery store but for all day was not good for me at all. They literally TRAP heat. :( sad.",US,2020-12-09
2,TERRIBLE for exercise. Don't get these if you sweat!,"I'm surprised by all the great reviews for these. They seem adequate for indoor non-exercise use, but they're terrible for exercise. The material gets sucked into my mouth when I breathe hard. The entire mask gets saturated with sweat and becomes so heavy that the elastic can't hold it up properly, and it slips off my face. Even if I stop and wring it out, or rotate through all three masks in a single class, it's wet, uncomfortable, and won't stay in place. I ordered Medium and received Large, but my I don't think a smaller size would help. It's just not the right material, weave, or structure for handling heavy breathing or sweat.",US,2020-10-06
2,Not so good for eyeglass wearers,"The only problem I have with this mask is that it does not fit snugly at the nose. Since I wear eyeglasses, my lenses are always fogging up making these masks more uncomfortable to wear than other masks that I own.",US,2020-07-22
2,Too Small,"I bought the ""XL"" size masks, and the size is a joke. It is more child size, and won't even fit over my nose and chin at the same time. Totally worthless for an adult male.

EDIT: The seller gave me a full refund when they found out I wasn't happy with their product so I have to thank them for good customer service.",US,2020-07-04
2,Slides down and off even after following measurement guide!,"I followed the size guidance a measure from the middle of of eye cavity to the bottom of my chin but the large size, which should have worked with an extra 1/2 inch to spare was just too small and uncomfortable to wear as it constantly slide down. My guess is the slightly larger XL might have worked better. Sadly, they are not returnable. I have just order another brand where large appears to be larger and contains an adjustable nose clip.",US,2021-01-10
2,"Comfortable, but stitching separation after a couple washes","I ordered these on November 20th, 2020. I clean them by adding to a light load in washing machine with clothes. I do not put them in the dryer. After a couple light washes, the stitching on one of the masks is starting to separate.
For the cost, these should be more durable. They are comfortable and breathe well, but I'm disappointed in build quality.
I do not recommend.",US,2020-12-03
2,Read the product descrption closely!,"The fit is perfect for me. I'm impressed with the way they fit over my nose and the lack of a gap on the sides.
When they say you should wash the masks before wearing, they really mean it. I hand washed mine in a bathroom sink. I could not believe the dirt left in the water.",US,2021-01-28
2,Too loose over the nose,"These are very comfortable to wear but there is a gap either side of the nose so that when you exhale, the air blows up into your eyes. I find this air flow very uncomfortable. Also the material is mostly polyester even though the ad says ""cotton blend"" (which is technically correct) it's mostly polyester.",US,2020-07-17
2,It gives the illusiaon of a mask,"The material is thin nylon. The purpose of the mask is to keep you from infecting others in many states it is mandatory in public places. It will fulfill the letter of the law for the mandatory mask decree but does not fulfill the purpose. The packaging stated to wash before first use and a lot of dye came out in the wash and now I have a bajillion stone grey socks. Finally, the ear loops are small and pull my ears forward. You will look like a howdy doody bank robber but you will be in compliance.",US,2020-08-09
2,Almost perfect.... poor quality,love the way these masks fit. I don't suffocate when wearing it for a few hours. Today was the first day I wore one and when I took it off realized it wasn't sewn properly and is coming apart. See picture. I was ready to buy more but the quality is not there so the search continues.,US,2020-07-15
2,Slides down when I talk,"I liked this mask when I got it. It's nice and comfortable, but it just seems to be too short between nose and chin, so it tends to slide down as my chin moves when I talk. It's more comfortable than disposable masks, but at least those stay up. I had read by a few people who said it was too big - I don't think so, I just think I need a bigger nose to hold it up!",US,2020-08-13
2,Use caution with the size you order,"Be careful of the size, I measured the bridge of my nose to my chin and added a little length. I ordered a large, which should have been big enough, it was smaller than I expected. I needed an extra inch (XL). The product is fine, it is a simple mask so how difficult is that to make, be aware of the size.",US,2020-09-18
2,NOT AS EFFICIENT AS EXPECTED,"Bought due to write up stating: Better breathability, stays in place if fit is correct. Followed the measuring directions twice to be sure; decided on LARGE as result of fit measurement. Once received, found mask keeps slipping down just like the 'throw-a-ways'? Breathing was no better than any others (I'm asthmatic so this is important).",US,2020-09-24
2,Comfortable but probably not protective,I agree with another reviewer who said that this mask fails the flame test. You can blow enough breath through the mask to extinguish a candle. That means that it probably would not provide an effective barrier against a cough or sneeze. Defeats the purpose of a coronavirus mask.,US,2020-12-14
2,One major flaw,"These are nice masks, fit well, and look great. They have one huge flaw, and that is the elastic is poor, so they end up getting very loose after wearing them a couple of times. One time through a gentle wash, and they have lost all elasticity, which is a bummer, because I really liked the way these masks fit. They still function ok, but they are constantly slipping down, which is a nuisance.",US,2020-11-18
2,low quality,"Low quality construction-

- cheap ear straps, thin elastic straps look nothing like the photos
- oversize cut- sticks out far from your mouth and face
- poor fit around nose- mask leaves large gaps on the sides of your nose
- oversized fit- mask is too larger overall",US,2020-10-14
2,"Great mask, questionable quality",Everything about these masks are great other than the quality is hit or miss - as soon as I went to put the first of three masks on the earpiece string detached. It was very poorly sewn together which was disappointing but the other 2/3 seem to be ok for now. If the first mask didn't rip immediately I'd give 5 stars but I question how long these other 2 will last - one star for each working mask,US,2020-07-15
2,Moves when talking,"The material is soft. It fits nicely. However, when you starting talking the mask moves down and no longer covers your nose. Your glasses will also fog when worn properly. The fit is loose. Nice attempt. If it had a nose clip, it would have 5 stars.",US,2020-07-16
2,"Too big, can't really use these","These (adult size) are too big for my 6 ft tall 170 pound man. He can't really use them.
Didn't return because we already opened and tried them.
I will keep them around in case someone larger stops by and needs one.
By the way, I used the size chart and ordered the size the chart indicated.",US,2020-07-02
2,Too big for 7-9 yr old,Daughter bought these for 7 & 9 yr. old girls. The elastic is very stretchy and overall mask too big in the nose area. Washed and dried in warm water and heat and no difference. Had to alter the masks on a sewing machine to make them fit right. So beware of the size.,US,2020-09-09
2,WAY too loose.,"Product is way too loose. No measurements listed anywhere. They claim ""large fits most adults"" and other reviews say a ""large is perfect for a petite woman"", but when you receive in hand, they're massive. Large is way too big for a 6' man, let alone a small woman unless you want a diaper hanging off your face. There isnt anything across the nose either - so expect loads of fog if you have glasses or wear safety goggles for work.",US,2020-11-04
2,"Not ""breatheable""","The worst thing about wearing a mask all day at work is the humidity and sweat from hot breath. This thing is really thick, like 2 or 3 layers, like a little pillow, and that means it's hot!

Probably fine if you just wear a mask for 30 minutes.",US,2020-09-01
2,Exposure of nose when talking,"Purchased these recently as I was in need of new masks. The biggest problem I have with these masks is that when I talk, the mask begins to fall and exposes my nose in the process. Possible that my small beard plays a part but these do not seem to be the solution for me.",US,2020-07-31
2,"Loops too large for child, fabric too small for teen or adult.","I have a 6 year old and a 9 year old. This fell right off both of them because the ear hoops were too long. I tied them together behind their heads in a pinch, but they weren‚Äôt comfortable wearing them. The fabric part is way too small for an adult. So these will be our last resort.",US,2020-09-23
2,"Honey, I shrunk my mask.","I was happy with the fit of the masks until I washed them a couple of times. They shrunk just enough to be uncomfortably snug making it more difficult to breathe. It‚Äôs dismaying because I deliberately chose to wash and dry them by hand, just to avoid shrinkage. Very disappointing.",US,2020-08-09
2,Not bad but heavy and warm,It‚Äôs like taking a really nice hoodie and cutting out a section and putting it over your face. So yes it‚Äôs comfortable and soft. But very warm and a little heavy. Also soaks up moisture. Not to be worn all day like I bought it for.,US,2020-07-28
2,"Single layer, smaller than expected for XL","Unfortunately, I fell for marketing-speak. While these are simple, decent quality masks, they are neither multiple layer nor as large as indicated for XL. If you just want a dust mask, these are fine but there isn‚Äôt adequate filtration.",US,2020-07-17
2,Traps moisture and is hot,These masks run quite large so they don't fit well. The worst part is the inside mesh type of fabric. It traps your breath and moisture. Therefore your face gets damp as well as makes you hot. Waste of money.,US,2020-10-22
2,"Has a hand-made feel, not sturdy, too flimsy","They're bigger, but the fit is all off for me personally. Take this with a grain of salt because everyone may fit differently, I wish there was a better way to measure and get an idea of the feel of various masks.",US,2020-10-05
2,Not worth it!,These masks fogged up my glasses so badly I really couldn‚Äôt wear them. I think that was because they fit so poorly which was especially disappointing because I paid more for then to avoid problems like these.,US,2020-10-17
2,poor fit if you talk with it on.,this is comfy to wear but if you talk at all it will pull the top down under your nose....,US,2020-09-18
2,Nope.,"The mask itself is nice but the ear loops however, are terrible! Mask would fit much better if the loops weren‚Äôt so cheap, crappy elastic. I‚Äôd return if my son didn‚Äôt HAVE to have these for school tomorrow. Big disappointment.",US,2020-09-07
2,Not XL. Just Regular,These are not XL mask. They barely reach my chin. Will give to the kids to use.,US,2020-07-15
2,I won't buy them again,"They don't seal to your face well. They don't have a nose wire to conform to the shape of your nose. So, they aren't effective in preventing air from slipping in past the mask.",US,2020-12-16
2,These have no wire or moldable nose pice,So the mask dose fit my large head but i wear glasses so with nothing to mold around the nose my glasses steam up consistently,US,2020-09-02
2,Too thin,Save yourself and do not buy. Sucks to your nose when you breathe.,US,2020-08-25
2,Too big for a 6 year old,"The ear loops are much too big for small children. They need to be at a minimum 1/3 smaller. I put one of the masks on and it fit me perfectly. So, I disagree that it is sized for children.",US,2020-07-09
2,Comfortable and fit great but..,"These masks fit really well and don't hurt my ears or touch my lips. These masks are comfortable at first however, they retain moisture which makes it very uncomfortable after a good 30min to 1 hr.",US,2020-10-28

2,Glasses fog,"I have yet to find a mask that does not fog my glasses, with or without a nose bride.
Maybe it's my face or my glasses.",US,2021-02-03
2,Does not stay in place,"I measured and I was well within the range of the large size but this slides down and off the nose from just talking so it's useless for wearing if you need to talk. I suppose it'd be OK if you never talked, yawned, or moved your mouth. I wish it would have worked as it is comfortable when it's in place.",US,2020-07-30
2,Sweat to death,So hot and hard to breathe. But the topics were answered fairly. You should have a rating for .....does it do what it is supposed to? Comfort?,US,2020-08-12
2,Needs wire at nose bridge,"I wish there was some sort of wire reinforcement at the nose bridge.
My glasses were constantly fogging",US,2020-11-07

2,Too big and smells gross,I measured as instructed and the medium is still way too large on me. There's also a gross chemical smell.,US,2020-08-18

2,"comfortable, but elastic broke after wearing twice","Pack of 3. Very comfortable. No gaps, good coverage. However, I wore one of the masks just twice and the elastic stretched and broke at the point where it connects into the mask. I wore the second one today and it's OK so far.",US,2020-08-04
2,Difficult to breathe with this mask,"I did not like this product, difficult to breathe with it on, especially if the weather is warm.",US,2020-07-23
2,Shrank after washing,I have a big head so I was looking for an XL face mask that wouldn‚Äôt pull on my ears. These appeared to fit great when I tried them on after first receiving them. Then I washed them in hot water (as recommended) and they shrunk. Now they are too small.,US,2020-07-21

1,I knew it was too good to be true (poor stitching),"Extremely disappointed. I was happy with these masks, fit well, but then I noticed that the stitching was poor - it's already ripping. I've only had three mask for a week or so.

A shame cause I wanted to order more, but poor craftsmanship is an issue. And I doubt I can return these.",Canada,2020-08-09
1,Product changed :/,"I ordered 2 packs of these back in August, they were perfect, fit well and no gapping near the cheeks due to the cut. Just ordered another 2 packs to learn that the cut has been changed (less shaped which is clearly easier for manufacturing) the nose bridge on the original ones dipped down lower, fitting closely to the face and worked nicely with glasses. The front of the mask also curved out more, allowing more space for the nose to not feel like it's being pressed on.

I would have highly recommend these masks to anyone, but after the change o would say it's a hard pass. Everyone in my family used these, and everyone is disappointed in the changes, sizing up or down won't change the comfort unfortunately if the same new pattern is followed, as it's too big in some spots and not big enough in others.",Canada,2020-11-02
1,"Do not buy, run away!!","They make the mask look big but it is not, it‚Äôs good photoshop work.
It‚Äôs only good for a five year old child‚Äôs size face. The ropes are too short and cause pressure on the back of your head, and the little rubber cinches come off the rope and there is nooooo way to get it back on which then makes the mask flop off of your face.
Add to that, they shrunk to a laughable size when we washed them, and put them in the dryer. I think I have a stuffed animal that could wear it at least!!!

Too late for me to refund, but not too late for you, run away!!!!",Canada,2020-11-15
1,Sizing is super weird and fits none of my kids,"These masks fit neither a 3-year-old NOR a 9-year-old. I bought this pack of masks for my 9 year-old. The height of the mask is so short, it will only cover his mouth OR his nose - not both. It does cover my 3-year-old's nose and mouth. So that's cool, I should be able to use the mask on my 3-year-old instead, right? Wrong. The mask is so wide and loops so long, it dangles off her face. Silly and useless - built for a kid with a disproportionately short, wide head.",Canada,2020-09-04
1,Way way too small. Not Worth the money.,"I ordered medium for my daughter. Her face measures from bottom of chin to bridge of nose 3.25"". I bought medium as that's what the chart said to do. Not even close. These masks are tiny!!! Total waste of money. Even the stitching on the mask across the front isn't centered. You open your üëÑ and the mask pulls down exposing your nose.",Canada,2020-09-10
1,All these masks do is build a false sense of security...,"There is absolutely no redeeming qualities about these masks. 3 layers of cloth, and what is this supposed to protect you from? Not even a chance of attaching a disposable filter? I should have done more homework on this. If you're looking for a fashion statement, buy this. If you're looking for actual protection...find something else with a disposable filter. These will do fine if you don't have any alternative. A terrible buy I regret. If I could give this product 0 stars I would.",Canada,2020-09-28
1,Some Ear Straps Defective,"I ordered this mask for myself and my mother, as we both have petite faces. The fit was a bit loose on both of us (see photo) but the material was odd - kind of basketball short material. Soft lining.

I would have kept the masks but in the pack of 3 two of the ear straps snapped while I was putting the masks on for the very first time. Overall mask seems sturdy but the construction of the ear loops is flimsy/delicate and liable to snap.

Would not purchase again, have returned.",Canada,2020-11-11
1,NOT BREATHABLE. GOT VERY HOT. BETTER MASKS OUT THERE.,Bought these because reviews were great. Not sure if the reviewers were paid as these masks are terrible. The mask got very hot within about 5 minutes of wear and are not breathable at all. It was not a hot day today (approx. 16 degrees). I bought 3 of the medium for me and my 2 sons but I can't see my kids being able to wear these for a long time as its NOT BREATHABLE.,Canada,2020-08-30

1,I ordered the large and extra large and there is quite a difference in size!,"I ordered the large and extra large and there is quite a difference in size!
In the picture the top mask is supposedly large and the bottom mask is extra large. The large masks are a little to small and the xtra large masks are a little to big. Either way you will be hard pressed to find ones that fit correctly.
Do to their return policy I have revised my original review to 1 star as they don‚Äôt do returns and they were a Amazon featured item which is extremely disappointing.",Canada,2020-11-11
1,Expensive garbage,"These are garbage. All 3 maks which are size ""large"" fit differently. Even though I measured it doesn't fit anyone in my house!! The straps are 1-2inches to long. The masks are lose and literally fall off your face.. see through as well so they will provide no protection. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS.",Canada,2020-08-26
1,this product is not what they portrayed it to be,i disliked the product because they said it was an extra large and showed pics of the mask covering the entire face well it doesn't it dint cover what the pics showed .It only covered my tip of my nose to my tip of my chin the pics showed bridge of nose to throat it is misleading to the buyer as far as comfort have no idea never wore the masks i cant comment on anything but the size and its not the right size to what they say. Im very disappointed i have purchased three sets of masks from different venders none of them fit i have a big face and need a huge mask,Canada,2020-12-29
1,Very upset with these masks. Inconsistent sizing.,"There is no rhyme or reason to the sizing of the masks, what a waste. They‚Äôre great if you get the proper size (good chance you won‚Äôt). But my size medium folded my ears right in half despite having a very small face. I purchased these masks because of the amazing reviews from friends and family but when it arrived it was all wrong. I‚Äôm very upset with this purchase. Doesn‚Äôt seem right to return it after being used.
Despite the company stealing my money, the masks are a good material and pretty breathable. Just wish they would send & manufacture the proper & consistent sizing.",Canada,2020-11-26
1,Too small of a fit. Don't waste money.,"SIZING IS WRONG-TOO SMALL!
These are way too small for a large and do not fit my face. What a huge waste of money and time. Amazon has to put a stop to vendors like this who pull the bait and switch with false reviews. These are absolutely useless to me and will have to accept my loss and (carefully) purchase replacements or just stick with the disposable ones.",Canada,2020-12-05
1,The white ones are not the same size as the black and blue.,"I purchased the black color first and it is great, I purchase blue next to have a change in color and the blue fit great as well. Liking these I thought I would Purchase the white ones have have all three colors that they supply. The white ones are not the same size they say large but are why to small. threw them in the garbage. Vary disappointed, they had a good thing going and made a mess of the white one.",Canada,2020-09-30
1,It does NOT pass the match test,"I was really excited to order these because I had read some reviews where people had mentioned it passing the match test... Sadly, that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. I didn‚Äôt even have to blow hard at all, it felt like the least safe mask for these circumstances. Maybe I got a bad batch? Regardless, I‚Äôm very, very disappointed.",Canada,2020-12-23
1,Breathable but at a cost,"honestly the most disappointing $27 purchase I‚Äôve ever made. The material is thin. It‚Äôs nicely made I can give them that but I was looking for a reusable mask that protects from the virus, not allow it to pass through the mask. It doesn‚Äôt pass the match test. Literally one blow and the match blew out (mind you it wasn‚Äôt even that hard of a blow from the mask) I‚Äôm so disappointed and it isn‚Äôt eligible for any form of compensation so I‚Äôm here with masks that don‚Äôt even do what they‚Äôre supposed to.",Canada,2020-10-25
1,Too expensive,"Like other reviews stated, can see through it when held up to light. I was able to blow out a match as well. Glasses fog up. I followed the measurements and my masks are slightly too big. I wouldn't buy again",Canada,2020-11-19
1,Lacking in comfort,So I wanted to try these and see how good they are. Very disappointed. And size was so big. I got the xl and I have a large beard as well. Was still so loose on my face. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend these,Canada,2020-11-05
1,This mask is not effective,"This face mask is not effective. There are no nose pinch or ear adjustments! It simply does n‚Äôt fit as described. Now, to discover that I cannot return the items, I have just lost over $26. NOT HAPPY Amazon!",Canada,2020-11-08
1,"Total rip off, DO NOT BUY!","These masks are worthless. The cloth does not pass air. All of my breath goes out through the top fogging up my glasses. My breath goes around the mask sending my unfiltered breath out around the edges of the mask. Same thing inhaling. I'm inhaling unfiltered air that comes in around the edges of the mask.

DO NOT BUY Amazon should be ashamed of products like this that give no protection what so ever.",Canada,2020-10-10

1,Not good...used masks!,"Received these in a non manufacturer bag It was an plastic bag. Masks were all defected. One had a white residue on the edge of the mask, another mask had holes throughout and one strap on a mask was ripped off. Very disappointed as the reviews from others were very good. Maybe I got a bad set, as these clearly appear to be used and possibly previously returned items.",Canada,2020-10-08

1,Variable sizes,"If this product doesn‚Äôt fit you it‚Äôs not your fault. I re-ordered the exact same ones after being happy with my first package.

1,OVERPRICED,"came damaged. does not fit face well (ordered a L based on measurement guide). no upper metal clip/band to increase seal closure. one of my masks has a tear in it, not the most durable masks in my opinion.

EXTREMELY overpriced.

2/10 gets the job done of appearing to wear a mask to satisfy mandates and guidelines. a disposable mask is far better but so wasteful to the environment.",Canada,2020-12-16
1,"Poor quality. Not consistent sizing. Torn elastic, no return option",Smaller Than last time I ordered a large .... also elastic is torn right out of the package .

This product isnt available for returns, I contacted the seller through their email and they did NOT reply at all.

1,Tiniest face mask,"I ordered the size large (after following measurement guide) and when these arrived, they were the tiniest face masks I've ever purchased.

1,Uncomfortable and waste of money,Honestly pretty terrible. They pill immediately after being washed so you get this pill feeling when you wear it. The ear loops are thin and uncomfortable.

I have been wearing these masks myself",Canada,2020-08-08

1,Masks very thin,"It‚Äôs hard to believe that these are three ply masks ‚Äî they‚Äôre very thin. Consequently, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that they offer much protection, particularly after they‚Äôve been washed a couple of times. I strongly discourage purchasing these.",US,2020-07-02
1,"INCONSISTENT sizing, scratching","Most recent update- I've bought around 5 packs of these. A mix of small, medium, and larges. The sizing is EXTREMELY INCONSISTENT. I received one medium pack that fit like a large, one large pack that fix XL and one small pack for children that fit like my mediums. Generally one mask or all masks in each pack have been sized wrong. Also the more I wear them the more I realize how uncomfortable the seams are. They are scratchy against my face and I find myself wearing these masks inside out to avoid the thick scratchy seams that turn my face red. I'm going back to disposable masks now.

**old review** (A second masks elastic just snapped) I hand washed them once and couldn't shrink them. After further inspection before hand washing I noticed one of the ear bands is torn and about to split in complete half. See in photos. The large is way to big for me and I definitely need a medium. The company is asking me to send a photo of the defective item but there is no attachment option on my app or mobil Amazon site. Therefore I'm posting the defective item on here for the company to see. ....OLD REVIEW..Nice but not a tight enough seal around my face. I'm a woman with a normal sized face and I just need it tighter. **update- The large mask sucked into my nose/mouth when I inhale. I have bought the medium size and no longer have issues. I recommend the medium size if you have issues like me. A proper fitting mask can do wonders.",US,2020-07-09

1 If you are getting this mask for protection against the virus forget it.

4. I returned it for sure.",US,2020-07-23

1,these are NOT XL,"I ordered these because I am a bit larger than average... 6 foot 4 inches 255 lbs... the standard mask barely covers my face... these are roughly the same size as medium masks, but the straps are SHORTER.... making them LESS COMFORTABLE than standard masks... DO NOT BUY if your purpose is to get a larger mask",US,2020-07-06
1,Don't believe the hype,"I bought these because they're on almost every single """"Best breathable, lightweight, moisture-wicking, etc. masks"" list (Rolling Stone, Good Housekeeping, etc.) Do NOT believe the hype. I hand-washed them very well (soap/rinse cycle 3x) using a Scrubba bag (THOSE are great) as soon as they came in, using Seventh Generation no scent detergent. For some reason, these smell like garlic or vinegar. It's definitely not my breath either because I've never had this happen and have been wearing masks every day since April. And, they're HOT. They're even hotter than the paper masks. My face drips sweat underneath these masks. These also made me realize that while they may be moisture-wicking, they definitely are not lightweight and/or breathable. Regarding size/fit, I measured my face per their instructions, and even though I was on the cusp between the Medium and the Large, I got the Large. Even with the Large, if I open my mouth to yawn, the mask slips down below my nose every single time. Lastly, and most important, these hurt behind my ears. It looks like it's going to be soft and pliable, but something about them makes them pull and hurt. Bottom line? Do not buy.",US,2020-08-21
1,Poor fit and inaccurate sizing,I ordered a set of L masks and received a package with both an L and XL label. The overall fit was loose and baggy and easily slid off my nose. I'm a decent sized guy 6'3 and about 215lbs. I've returned these and will be searching for a better option.,US,2020-07-10

1,Dangerous. Don't protect against Covid spread,"These masks are so thin and porous that they are pointless in preventing the spread of Covid. When I got them I immediately realized what a mistake this purchase was. I did two of the tests to see if your mask is effective:
1) When you hole them up to a light source can you see through it?
2) Can you blow out a flame while wearing it.
The results:
When you hold them up to light you can see tons of holes. I saw more holes than stars in a country night sky.
I was able to blow out a candle while wearing the mask.

It scares me to know that thousands of people are wearing these wildly ineffective masks. DON'T BUY THESE SO CALLED MASKS!",US,2020-09-02
1,Awful masks. How they have such good ratings is beyond me.,"I spend over an hour trying to decide which masks to buy, and settled on these because of the reviews, but the number of stars and specifically what some people wrote about them. Imagine my surprise then when I got them and they were absolutely awful!

1. The are packaged so you have to destroy the package to try them on. I guess that makes sense given what they are, but I assume it meant I could not return them because I would have immediately.

2. Since I had to keep them I tried them for 1/2 a day. The first issue is they leave a large gap between my cheeks and the bridge of my nose; does not feel very secure to me.

3. And while wearing it the mask keeps slipping off my nose, and almost just as bad constantly feels like it is going to slip off my nose. So I can't wear it without constantly being made aware of it and having to adjust it.

4. The fabric is super thin, and feels like it wouldn't last more than 2 or 3 washings.

5. Similarly the ear loops feel very fragile, like they are apt to break in the not too distant future.

On the plus side it is easy to breath in them, but I would rather be comfortable I am safer from COVID-19 and not have to constantly (think about) adjust(ing) the mask than be less inconveniences by the mask.

Don't waste your money. Look for something else.",US,2020-12-01
1,The WORST masks money can buy,"These masks are horrible! It wouldn‚Äôt stay on my face for even 10 minutes. It kept falling off my nose. Plus, I was sweating profusely under the mask in 70 degree weather and I couldn‚Äôt breathe or talk with the mask on. What a complete waste of money! To top it all off, it appears they sent me the wrong size. The package says medium even though their sticker says adult small. I am so regretting this purchase!",US,2020-08-02
1,Not effective as virus protection.,"There is no nose bridge wire to help stop fogging up your glasses. There is no additional sleeve internally for adding a PM2.5 filter. They are 3-ply and they are comfortable, but they do not seal.",US,2020-07-27
1,Too hot!,These masks are too hot. My face was drenched with moisture and sweat when wearing these. They are also too rounded at the nose. They fit size wise but if you have a pointy nose they will push against it and get painful after about 15 minutes of wearing it. The material is like a bra and starts to pill after rubbing on my whiskers. There is also a large seam that runs down the middle that after the mask gets moist starts to rub on your lips which makes talking very difficult. I do not recommend these masks.,US,2020-07-20

1,No.,"Do not recommend.

You can see the holes in the fabric with the naked eye when holding up to light, so you can imagine what's happening at the microscopic level of a virus.

Loose fitting (despite following the measurement instructions), very hot, uncomfortable.

1,Not As Advertised,"I thought I finally found an extra large face mask that is comfortable for me. However, the XL size is really about a large and the earloops does not really stretch.

1,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR PROTECTION FROM CORONA VIRUS,"I bought a 3-pack of large size masks to help protect against the Corona virus. The first thing I did when I tried them on was the lighter test because they felt very thin (even though they‚Äôre 3 layers). It failed the test miserably. The flame went out without much force at all. Almost as if I wasn‚Äôt wearing anything. I was very disappointed because there was a question about the lighter test and the person who answered said it passed the test (the flame stayed lit), but it doesn‚Äôt. The fact that it failed means there‚Äôs too much airflow through the mask. These masks will do little, if anything, to protect you from the virus. The fit was fine although there were gaps around the nose as there is no nose bridge, which I knew when I bought them. I‚Äôm sure these work fine for protecting from dust particles, but that wasn‚Äôt my intention. I wouldn‚Äôt purchase these for any medical purpose.",US,2020-09-09

These masks are NOT 3-ply......AND....they don't pass the candle test. You can easily feel your breath if you just put your hand in front of the mask......and.......if you subject it to ""the candle test"" they fail. The candle test is to put a mask on and see if you can blow out a candle. Well.....that's super easy.

1,Evaded Questions until After return period; Barrier/Safety Mask/Nano Technology - MEANINGLESS,"The SAFETY masks ordered were advertised as made of 3 layers and also advertised as ""Barrier"" / ""Safety"" Masks / ""NanoFine Cotton Blend"".

I realized that I was be able to blow out candle THROUGH the mask.
I contacted company.
Asked about terms used in product description:
1. To what is this a Barrier / Safety to?
2. What particle size do you estimate that this mask protects against?
3. What particle size do you estimate that this ""NanoFine"" mask protects against?
4. The term/prefix ""nano"" means one billionth (1/1,000,000,000).
But, it does not say one billionth of what unit of measure (e.g. mile, meter, inch, etc.)
And, is the term nano (unit of measure) referring to thread width or pore size?
5. Was all this verbiage meaningless marketing language?

They returned with delays and non-answers, then stopped responding after the product return period ran out.
Barrier/Safety Mask/Nano Technology - MEANINGLESS Marketing terms

I strongly suggest NOT buying these masks, unless you get Actual answers to these questions.
""Money Back Guarantee"" is also Meaningless Marketing terms.
They will delay until the return expiration date, then will not respond any further

1,"Better than nothing, but...","This mask does not seal from the bridge of the nose to the cheekbone area thus making this mask useless for protection from Covid, dust, etc. Also, if you wear glasses, they will fog up due to the gap between the mask and your face every time you exhale.

I've worn them multiple times to go grocery shopping since receiving and couldn't understand why my simple grocery runs were becoming so unbearable.

1,Don‚Äôt buy this mask! It offers limited protection!,The mask is breathable however when looking through it in the light it‚Äôs obvious the layers don‚Äôt block sunlight.

1,"Baggy, even when instructions are followed","The mask was loose and baggy, with poor elastic strength. I used tailor's measuring tape and followed all of the sizing instructions, but the size was ridiculously off.",US,2020-07-23
1,Very comfortable but (unfortunately) totally useless,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It‚Äôs comfortable and easy to wash. But it won‚Äôt stay in place, so it‚Äôs not helpful at all.",US,2020-09-12
1,I don't see HOW they can these three-layer,"I got these today and was VERY unimpressed. They are two layers thick, not three.
I wrote the manufacturer and will probably return due to misrepresentation.",US,2021-01-13
1,No wire so it will not seal,"Not sure why people are giving this a high review. The whole idea of a face mask is to breathe ""through"" the mask rather than around it. This mask doesn't have a way to seal around your nose. It may look like you are wearing a mask, but in reality there is no seal so it is not protecting anyone against virus transmission.",US,2021-02-03
1,When I washed these(before wearing) they tore up on the seams!,When I washed these(before wearing) they tore up on the seams!,US,2020-08-22
1,Poor quality elastic bands.,Cloth is very soft and it would have been a good fit. The elastic is already way too stretched out and they have not even been worn yet. I tried it on my 8 year old and my 5 year old. If it was made with high quality elastic the fit would be great. On one of the elastic bands it‚Äôs already tearing and we just opened the package.,US,2020-10-04
1,No bendable nose tab,"Nice mask...except for one critical thing. There's no bendable strip at the top to make the top of the mask fit snugly across the cheeks and nose bridge. As a result, there's a gap which allows your breath to escape and air to be inhaled. It defeats the purpose of COVID protection and, thus, is a waste of money.",US,2020-09-15
1,Not 3 ply at all!!!!,"This item is NOT 3 ply at all. When I received the pack and opened it, it had a horrible smell to it and the material was very thin and most definitely not 3 ply as described. I held the mask up to the light and the light came through with no problems, why because it's 1 ply junk thin material. I should have known, the label was ""Made in Vietnam"". Might as well put a nylon stocking over your face, you would have just as much protection with that than these face masks. Not as advertised and should edit their description to 1 ply thin material. Will be returning and never buy from this vendor again. If you are buying this for any type of protection against an airborne virus, DON""T buy it because it will not protect you. JUNK MASKS!",US,2020-11-05
1,false sense of security,"These masks lack a critical feature which is a metal strip to fit the mask securely around the nose. The mask which is not cheap allows a lot of air to enter and exit at the nose, thus defeating the purpose of wearing one. The minimum rating is KN95 which these masks aren't. N95 is the best but good luck trying to find one They are comfortable and allow very easy breathing but so what.",US,2020-10-15
1,NOT extra large,"Very disappointing. Not large enough and no nose wire to help get a seal. Description says 3-ply but it is very thin, more like the thickness of a t-shirt.",US,2020-08-09
1,Hold this mask up to light. Light shines right through fabric.,"This mask is right out of the package.
If you hold this mask up to the light, a lot of light shines through it.
There are visible tiny holes
Compare this to even a basic disposable mask like they give you at the clinic. There are no visible holes in the clinic mask. I do not claim to be an expert, however this does not seem to be effective.",US,2020-12-11
1,Doesn‚Äôt protect,"Garbage, doesn‚Äôt even protect you
I did the lighter test: where you hold a lighter in front of your face and blow. I blew the fire out every time
So disappointed",US,2020-07-09
1,Don't get this for Covid/Coronavirus protection!,I was outside and thought to put the mask up into the light to see if it passes through. It does and it's worse when I used my phone's flashlight. This is not safe to wear if you're trying to protect yourself from Covid.,US,2020-08-12
1,No nose piece Fogs glasses. allows unfiltered air in and out,I don't think this mask is worth wearing. There is a gap at the nose which is usually sealed with a piece of metal to ensure breath is filtered and not exhausted out the gap. Also it allows unfiltered air to enter through this gap and then into your lungs.,US,2021-01-13
1,No nose wire for secure fit,"These masks could be great - they're comfortable and larger than others I've tried. However, there is no nose wire to help them conform with a secure fit. This is bad for protection and if you wear glasses, it makes the mask impossible to use. Every exhalation fogs your glasses, badly.",US,2020-08-03
1,Be ready to sweat,"I found these masks to be very hot, even in winter. Within minutes, I felt suffocated. Not to mention my glasses fogged up within seconds.
I returned these in favor or the 32 Degrees masks you can pick them up at Costco for much cheaper than on Amazon.",US,2021-01-07
1,Very small and cheaply made.,"Very cheaply made and none too big. I‚Äôm not sure they provide much protection. I can‚Äôt wear them as they‚Äôre too small to fit comfortably around my ears, even fully stretched. They are essentially a couple of layers of slick, polyester-feeling material with very little stretch.",US,2020-09-06
1,Laughably Bad Quality. TRASH - DO NO BUY THESE!,"I just received these minutes ago. I open the package and attempted to try on one of the masks. I didn't even get it on my face before it broke! The part that loops around your ears, detached from the mask with almost no force. I barely began to stretch the ring to bring it around my ear and it detached from the mask! Now I will have to repair this mask with a sewing kit or return the items. I am so disappointed, and I feel as if I've been ripped off. They essentially took my money and sent me some trash.",US,2020-08-21
1,Not worth it,"I ordered these specifically for working out and they are not as advertised. I find these as difficult to breathe in as any other regular mask. They are fairly soft and comfortable but do not provide any ease in breathing. I have also noticed this mask holds in a lot of moisture and is often damp after a workout and makes my face sweat a lot. Not happy with these and won't buy again. So far, the best I have found are from Athleta and are sold in packs of 5 for $30.",US,2021-01-19
1,Poor quality; ineffective.,These are NOT three-ply. The material is too thin and stretchy to be effective as intended. I will never buy these again and refused to wear them. I‚Äôm beginning not to trust reviews posted on Amazon. This is a perfect example.,US,2020-12-20
1,Worthless with glasses,"Ordered these because of others' reviews saying they don't fog: well, they do, and even worse/quicker than the other masks I'm trying to replace. They're comfortable, but worthless if you wear glasses and want to be able to see where you're going.",US,2020-10-23
1,Don't waste your money on it.,"The mask itself was too floppy. When you go to talk, and take a breath, it goes into your mouth. Mind you, this person who it was bought for is extra large as well. I'm returning because they're a waste of good money.",US,2020-12-07
1,Smell bad and don't provide a good seal,Had a strong odor when they arrived. After I washed them as instructed they still have a strong chemical odor. They leave gaps at the sides of my nose they all the air goes in and out of that area. I don't feel safe with them,US,2020-12-10
1,Better pass this up...,"The material is very soft and comfortable and an ample size. The ear loops are very soft as well. It's easy to be wearing this all day, but it's just not breathable. Even sitting down or just standing still is very uncomfortable as it's too warm, despite not being tight. The blue hospital masks nurses wear are more more breathable than this one.",US,2020-11-30
1,Nope,"These masks are super soft and they feel good on your skin. Not your face skin, but the rest of your skin is great. They are itchy on my face, and have no structure, and block air like a floppy brick wall. Not a fan of this mask.",US,2020-11-14
1,Poor product,"If you don‚Äôt talk they‚Äôre nice but once you talk they fall down
Defeats the purpose of the mask on your face over your nose
Would not recommend",US,2020-08-03
1,Mask broke during first use,Ear band seam wasn't stitched properly and pulled free during first use. Had to stitch it back together. Very comfortable otherwise. Worried that the other two masks won't stand up. We will see.......,US,2020-12-27
1,Ohe size is way off.,"I ordered these because they had a XL size offered. They fit me ( I'm female, 5' 6"") but not even close for the 6'3"" person they were ordered for!!!!",US,2020-08-02
1,Very lightweight.,"Fits well, but very lightweight you can blow through it which means it's not stopping moisture particles from going in and out",US,2020-07-24
1,pulls down immediately,"Pulls down below my nose the instant I talk or move my jaw. Another review posted a video of the same thing. Will have to return unfortunately.

Update: to clarify I measured per instructions, was exactly in the middle of the large range so ordered that. I don‚Äôt know if going up a size above their recommendation would help.",US,2020-09-24
1,Don‚Äôt waste your money.,Don‚Äôt waste your money. Theses masks are not good at all. Material is cheap no quality fabric. Water resistant: when I pour water in the middle of the mask it when thru because is sew in the middle. The most important part to over is the nose and the mouth and it is not water resistant. Large size is small. I will love to return the three masks but I already washed all three. If wear make sure to use a surgical mask under. I won‚Äôt use it alone.,US,2020-11-25
1,WAY TO BIG. POORLY DESIGNED üò°,"Way too big! I purchase a medium size. The ear loops are too large, there is no nose wire, so the mask falls right off my face. I don‚Äôt recommend these masks. Too much money for such a poor design",US,2020-09-18
1,Not as described,Very very thin. No clasp/metal over nose. Useless.,US,2020-12-20
1,NOT AN EXTRA LARGE MASK,This product is not an extra large protective mask. It is an extra small mask! The size of this mask is a major disappointment. If you are looking for a small mask this is exactly what you need. But if you a looking for an extra large mask do not consider this product. What a ripoff!!!!,US,2020-10-11
1,Inconsistent sizing!,This is my second time ordering. First set was great. Good quality. I needed the larger XL size. This second order is a STEP UP IN Size (XXL !) and I may not be able to use. Way too big for my wife. Disappointing. I can report a friend had a similar experience.,US,2020-09-07
1,Don't buy,"this product is cheap, flimsy and without any means to tighten around the nose. As a result, your glasses will fog up when you use it. Threw them in the trash rather than hassle with a return.",US,2020-10-09
1,Poor quality masks,These masks are thin and are a poor fit. The ear loops are too big and do not fit the masks close to your face to form a seal. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this inferior product.,US,2020-11-28
1,SWEAT 'STACHE,"Hot, sweaty trash. Had a dripping sweat 'stache.

These masks suuuuuuuuck.

They do not breathe. They are way too baggy. It was awful wearing it.",US,2020-09-03
1,"Horrible, and too small. No option for return/refund, so it‚Äôs a scam!","Literally a waste of money- there‚Äôs no option for a refund, and for twenty dollars you get three baby sized masks that don‚Äôt even fit. Send me masks that fit my face. There‚Äôs a literal pandemic and you feel it necessary to scam people? Disgusting. They wouldn‚Äôt even fit a toddlers face, let alone my own.",US,2020-10-10
1,Not as expected,"The large is more like a medium and does not fit well at all, and the strings that go around your ears are so small, they would probably break in no time. I am sending mine back.",US,2020-10-04
1,"These masks do not pass the ""Flame Test.""","I purchased these masks to stay safe when out in public, during Covid. The masks are comfortable, but failed the flame test. A mask should reduce spreading particles. If material is so thin or stretchy that you could blow out a flame while wearing the mask it is an indication particles are also escaping. We kept the masks because if all three are worn at the same time, the candle stayed lit.",US,2020-11-17
1,makes your face sweat...,"Makes your face sweat! Then comes the pimples/acne. I can not wear them!
Comfortable and soft but sweating is unbearable and normaly, I don‚Äôt sweat in FL!",US,2020-10-17
1,Not 3 ply,"We were looking for good quality masks. These masks are NOT 3 ply as advertised. When the package arrived, there is nothing on the literature with it that claims they are 3 ply. I did the flashlight test with my 3 ply masks and with these and there was a stark difference. The light shines right through these. And I don't see a way to add a filter to them.",US,2020-11-21
1,No nose strip-useless,Doesn't seal due to no nose strip. Fogs up my glasses. Better than nothing but not by much. Will be using something else.,US,2020-07-29
1,Saggy mask,"The masks we received sag/ slip when being worn. Though they are on snugly, the fabric across the nose/cheeks sags and slips down if you are talking, rendering it useless.",US,2020-08-11
1,Use if you want to breathe in covid,"Tested this, your breathe can be blow through which means you can suck in some covid as well. Not a surgeon grade mask with breathability.",US,2020-12-24
1,Not adjustable at nose,Be advised that these masks do not have an adjustment at the bridge of the nose and when wearing there is a gap at the top. This will let in particles and also fog glasses.,US,2020-08-02
1,Great fit. Bad durability.,"First off, these fit great for my big head. Very soft and decently breathable. HOWEVER, the ear strap broke after only 5 hours! Thankfully it‚Äôs a 3pack and hopefully the others will last longer.",US,2020-11-24
1,You may need to order a size up.....,"Not happy at all with this purchase. Received the masks the other day, took one out of the bag to do a test fit. Masked fit great. Not too loose, not too tight. I washed it on cold, then dried on medium heat with other bits of clothing. The damn things shrunk. F*&king useless now. Material is Ok; There seemed to be room to add additional material if one wanted. Won't be buying again. If you do, may want to go a size up from what you normally order.",US,2020-08-17
1,Flimsy,Very disappointed. Used the size chart and these are way too small. The strap broke the first time I put it on and there is no reinforcing seam down the middle as shown in the product photos. It's just a flimsy piece of fabric. Cannot recommend this mask.,US,2020-08-20
1,Not as Advertised,Not as advertised. Not cotton. No Filter Pocket. Sized for small child. Made of thin one layer open weave polyester. Zero Stars Actual Rating. 1 Star is forced.,US,2020-07-26
1,MASKS COULD BE DEADLY!,Masks are VERY comfortable but have no bendable nose piece to hold them anywhere NEAR your face on top. Deadly design flaw! Worthless.,US,2020-11-17
1,Mask slides down,The mask slides down when I am engaging in conversation. My nose is completely exposed which is problematic. I am not happy with these mask.,US,2020-08-01
1,Fogs glasses,Masks did not have a metal clip on nose bridge to reduce fogging of glasses. All masks should have this feature. Ordered largest size and it just covers my mouth and nose.,US,2020-08-27
1,Didn‚Äôt fit well,Did not fit my face. I finally ordered some from another company in the same size and they fit well. Would not stay up well on my face.,US,2020-07-31
1,No wire over the nose like the last ones!,This was a reorder from the same company. But we were cheated out of the wire over the nose. These are impossible to keep in place.,US,2020-12-16
1,So Disappointing,"These masks are not what you want. They would not pass the candle test because they are too thin, so I sent them back. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these because they don‚Äôt seem to offer much protection",US,2020-09-28
1,Hard to breathe,I don‚Äôt like these whatsoever. Smaller than expected and the material makes us sweat like crazy making it very difficult to breathe. It‚Äôs a big no for me.,US,2020-11-11
1,"Delay. Delay, Delay, Delay Radio Silent","Five days later, nothing. Bought another product, arrived in less than 24 hours.

Waste of money, threw them in the garbage.",US,2020-12-06
1,Silver Nanoparticles,"Had I known that one of the layers of fabric was coated in silver nanoparticles, I would not have bought this. The description just says, NanoFine Cotton Blend, for the inner layer. There has not been any human studies done on ingesting these particles. The testing results on non-human subjects does not look good.",US,2020-11-04
1,Way too small,I ordered size Large and they are way too small for an adult. This might be a great mask for a 10 year old but not a normally sized adult. Keep shopping!,US,2020-11-02
1,Smelled like cigarettes.,This is the second time buying this product and I was disappointed because they smelled like cigarette smoke and the package was ripped open. The first time I ordered there were no issues so it was really strange. Try working out with a mask that smells like cigarettes. Not good.,US,2020-09-16
1,Ear loop are very pooly attached and come off easily - would not buy again.,"I purchased this on Dec 1 2020, 2 of the 3 masks have already had this problem even with only a few hours a day of usage. The ear loops arent a completed loop through the mask fabric but sewn in at the edges. As a result the ear loops pull out with only moderate stretching. I do not reccomend these.",US,2021-01-08
1,Way too small,I got the youth medium and a baby couldn't even wear these. They look like the size of a panty liner.,US,2020-10-25
1,Poor product evaluation,"Of the three masks one is coming apart at the seam and on another the seam comes to the edge. The statement ""created with the highest caliber of materials and attention to detail"" on the EnterPlex packing is untrue
and should be removed.",US,2020-08-02

1,Run Much Larger Than Expected,Bought medium for myself small frame 5‚Äô1‚Äù tall and XL for my husband. He ended up keeping the mediums for himself and I‚Äôm returning the XL for small and hope they will fit. They are great masks and seem very comfortable but sizing is way off.

1,Wrong size sent,"Twice now when ordering size ""small"" they send me what seems to be a size medium to large.

1,"Comfortable, but not safe at all.","Whomever said these masks pass the fire test, you are wrong. Air DOES get through these... Like, I can feel my breath outside of the mask when it's on me.

Again VERY DISAPPOINTED, DO NOT PURCHASE THESE!!",US,2020-10-27

1,Too small and tight!,I ordered the medium size since the product description said that fits most adults. It is too small barely covers the area fro nose to chin. The straps behind the ear are too snug and they hurt after a few minutes of wear. I would recommend getting large or even extra large.,US,2020-10-09

1,"Too Big, Company Needs to Change Sizing Suggestion","Product says large fits most adults, but the mask is so big on my face that even the motion of walking makes it slip right off my face after a couple steps.

Order a smaller size than large unless you're an absolute unit.",US,2020-08-15
1,Won't Protect Me,Troubling lack of filtration. Air flows in/out the top of the mask (around my nose) letting in unfiltered air. Also steaming up my glasses. I cannot recommend this item.,US,2020-07-27
1,What is happening with size??,I ordered a small size for my 8 yr old. She has an average size face. When worn the masks fit well. However they slip off the moment she starts talking. Sizing is not as advertised. I can use this mask as an adult. For this reason this is rated 1.,US,2020-10-20

1,Too soft. Collapses around face and mouth,Package says to wash before using. I did. Too bad. With a little starch you can breath thru the stiffened sides. But once it's washed it becomes very soft and collapses over your mouth. My daughter noticed the same thing. Too bad.,US,2020-10-05

1,Not for covid use- cool wash only,These look good and are comfortable BUT I should have read the washing instructions. Not suitable for use as covid mask as they can only be washed on cool so any virus or bacteria on the mask can‚Äôt be destroyed when it‚Äôs washed. Good as a dust protector only I‚Äôd say.,US,2021-01-22
1,What you should know before you buy these.,"I am making homemade masks, but I wanted to try some masks that are mass-produced to see how they feel and fit. I found these very comfortable and lightweight. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm thrilled with the polyester and I think overall I prefer my 100% cotton home-made masks better.

Be aware though, this mask is treated with ‚ÄúAgion‚Äù antimicrobial agent. This chemical is used by businesses and hospitals to treat surfaces and guard against covid-19/corona virus. It is effective, although Kaiser Permanente recently stopped using this chemical (I‚Äôm not sure why, but I‚Äôm assuming because of safety concern).

By googling ‚ÄúAgion‚Äù I was able to find some information about this chemical, but I am not convinced it is safe.

For this mask, the Agion is applied to the inner layer of the mask. The mask is composed of 3 layers as follows:
Shell layer: 100% polyester DWR
Middle Layer: 65% polyester, 35% cotton
Inner Layer: 65% polyester, 35% cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent

You absolutely need to wash these before wearing them. They recommend it on the package and with the chemical treatment I think you should not wear this mask right out of the package. I am washing before using, but I am not sure that washing actually removes this chemical.

I am also somewhat apprehensive wearing these masks. I don‚Äôt know that I trust the manufacturer of the chemical who says it is ‚Äútotally safe‚Äù. There‚Äôs so many chemicals that have been used throughout human history that end up being cancer causing, so I am very much apprehensive that this chemical is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.

I really wanted to give these masks a good rating, but just the fact they don‚Äôt disclose this chemical is used on the product on the Amazon product page, makes me even more apprehensive. Why did they apply it? Is it removed with washing or does it stay on the fabric long-term. From what I gathered from my internet research, the chemical will be effective for 90 days when used on surfaces.

I doubt most people would even know since the packing is usually just thrown out by the consumer. I can not in my right mind give this product a good rating.",US,2020-06-18

1,"Too small, ineffective.","This ""xl"" mask is barely larger than a standard mask and is much too small if you have a beard. The loose weave fabric is useless for preventing the spread of germs (I blew out a candle with the mask on just to prove this point). I would return them if I could.

I am not able to determine the type of fabric used. There is no provision for a crimp seal at the nose, but that was never advertised as being there. If you are getting this for virus safety, don't waste your money. Made in Vietnam, but that would not be a problem if the quality was decent. The only purpose this mask serves is if you are required to wear a mask, you can say you are. Might also be useful for bank holdups.",US,2020-07-11

I‚Äôm giving a one star because the whole idea that we have to wear masks everywhere now in the first place is completely pathetic and ridiculous and I never thought our country would come to this.,US,2020-08-01
1,Too many problems,"These masks are slightly more comfortable than the blue surgical masks. It still pulls too tight on the tip of my nose.

Anybody who says they don't fog up your glasses is crazy. These fog up my glasses to the point where I would rather just toss them in the trash.

One of the 3 masks has a huge discrepancy in the length of the elastic that goes around your ears. One side pulls tighter than the other so can't wear that one at all.

One of the 3 masks has a big dimple in the center of the mask like it was stitched too tight in that area.

I have to talk while wearing a mask at my job. It does not stay on your nose as soon as you open your mouth. And yes, I ordered the right size according to the measurement chart. Pretty much these masks are an all around failure, especially for the price.

I think somebody needs to design a mask that has the metal piece in the bridge of the nose AND a metal piece that can be curved in the opposite direction to hug your cheek.

I would not recommend these. I am going to try something else.",US,2020-10-01

From the reviews and comments I thought I was ordering the correct size as both my wife and I fell within the large range and we could share them. When they arrived they were more child-sized. When they are on if you open your mouth the mask pulls down off your nose. The ear stretch rings are way too thin, flimsy and stretchy and do not hold mask in place very well. If I would purchase the x-large they would undoubtedly not fit my wife.",US,2020-07-19
1,Confortable but...,"I just got these face masks today. I put one on and was a little disappointed. The face mask is very comfortable and light. The material feels very good. I was disappointed, however, as the fit is not tight. The mask does not have a nose wire as N95 and many other masks do. The fit on my nose was very light. I could feel my breathing coming out thru the top of the mask. When I inhale I could inhale particles thru the top of the face mask as well. Not very reassuring. If they had a nose wire I could get a tighter fit. UPDATE: I have been trying to fix the no nose wire thing to make it fit better and I just realized that the mask will not offer COVID-19 protection as it seems to allow small particles like COVID19 thru. I simply cannot recommend these masks and I will not be using them.",US,2020-09-10

Polyester mask, not cotton","It states, ""Key Features: EnerPlex Face Masks are a Three-Layer Design ‚Äì Outer layer DWR 100% Polyester, Middle Layer Cotton Blend, Inner Layer NanoFine Cotton Blend"". What I got was Outer layer 100% polyester, Middle layer 65% polyester, 35% Cotton, Inner Layer 65% polyester 35% cotton. It is more polyester, not cotton. I bought this because it stated the two inner layers were a cotton blend. Polyester is not a cotton. False description. I cannot wear this mask.",US,2020-12-18
1,Fails to deliver on promises,"Using the provided measurement guide I determined the Large mask would be the correct choice. I found them to be so small that they barely covered my face from the bridge of my nose to under my chin. The loops that go behind the ears are also too small which leads to the mask pulling uncomfortably forward on my ears. The material is so thick it is hard to breathe through the mask. In short, it fails to deliver all the things it promises to provide. A waste of money.",US,2020-10-02
1,"Hot, thick","Hot, thick. Like wearing cotton underwear on the face. Not a happy experience.",US,2020-07-05
1,Comfortable but Fogs Up Glasses,"Although comfortable, I found these to be essentially useless, as wearing the mask guarantees that my glasses will immediately fog and stay fogged. I do not have this problem with masks that have an adjustable nose clip.

EDIT: I was contacted by the manufacturer after posting my review and offered a refund or replacement. I choose a refund. Based on this customer service, I would recommend trying out the mask for yourself as you have nothing to lose.",US,2020-09-30
1,Way too small- can't return,"I had high hopes for these masks, however they do not fit properly and are way too small for me. Once opened, I could not return, so am forced to keep these. Even after machine washing per the instructions, they still have a strange odor to them. Not happy with this item or getting stuck with them.",US,2020-07-07
1,Nice Material but non-functional design lacking a wire for making a seal,For masks to be effective they need to have a wire at the bridge of your nose so that it conforms and creates a seal with your face otherwise the air just goes right around it since air will always take the path of least resistance. This means only some of the air you exhale is actually going through the fabric which is how a mask is supposed to catch the tiny water droplets that potentially carry viruses and thus makes them useless.,US,2020-11-03
1,"Poor customer service, even worse product.","I spent the time reading many of the reviews to get an idea about the breathability, tightness and adjustability of the mask. I measured myself twice. I ordered the extra large and it was way bigger (I mean over 1 inch) than what was described in the sellers product sizing chart. I tried multiple times contacting the seller prior to turning it and no one got back to me. Extremely poor customer service and lack of attention to detail on the sellers website and product size description make these masks useless to me and have wasted a lot of my time.",US,2020-12-19
1,Not the same product. Suggest looking and purchasing elsewhere.,"Bought the blue version of this mask earlier this year and liked it. Selected ‚Äòbuy it again‚Äô option and only black color was available. Completely different product in every way‚Äî‚ÄòL‚Äô size is much smaller, super thin straps and poor construction. One big negative about ordering on Amazon is there is little, if any quality control. This means the seller can swap out any item without changing the product details if item is different from the original. That seems to be the case here. I would recommend you look and purchase elsewhere.",US,2021-01-01
1,VERY SMALL. If this is XL the Small must be for toy dolls.,"I‚Äôm 6 foot 2 and larger than most, but I‚Äôm not giant by any means. Smothers my face. Cloth is too thick too. Doesn‚Äôt breathe at all. Seriously needs a total redesign. At least an inch bigger all directions and softer breathable fabric. Come on guys, someone needs to make a wearable mask for above average sizes.",US,2020-07-09
1,The sizes are off,"The smallest of these masks were for like a newborn or something. The XL covered half my husband's face. I don't know what is going on with these sizes. I bought L, kids small and XL and the large was like normal so I dunno. It was not worth the money since there is no nose clip it just slides off and the ear loops aren't adjustable.",US,2021-01-24
1,Didn‚Äôt fit my kids but fits me,"Purchased a small and it does not fit my 3 year old, 7 year old, NOR my 11 year old.. even with the head adjustment strap i purchased from another seller this mask does not fit. It fits me perfectly though, but not my kids.",US,2020-07-08
1,Suffocating,"I got these so I could stop using the disposable ones. They are soft and have a nice fit and stretch. But I wore it for a few minutes yesterday while I received a delivery and these make breathing so difficult. I'm glad I got to use them before I went to town in the heat. That would not have been good. I washed them all, so I can't return them. I regret this purchase.",US,2020-08-16
1,"Doesn't fit, too thin to be effective","The mask is too small, slides off my face while talking, and does not seal well across my face - too loose with no adjustment option. I measured and selected my size according to the instructions. Having now read other low rating reviews, I agree it seems thin for a 3-ply and ineffective as a COVID mask. A bit disappointed given all the good reviews, even on ReviewMeta. Probably just doesn't fit my face but my other masks (different vendors) do, so I'm returning it.",US,2020-10-26
1,Poor quality,Returned item because the product looked too thin to be able to protect from droplets.,US,2020-08-20
1,Sorry but Amazon did not properly deliver,"Amazon indicated that the product was delivered to a ""secure location"" with no details in the middle of 40 mile an hour winds. The product is very light weight and apparently simply blew away somewhere. Reporting it to Amazon produced no results in their typical no customer interaction. Their typical ""delivery"" is just placed on the front steps. With the winds that day no telling where it ended up? Of course Amazon is unresponsive. Next stop a hold on the credit card charge.",US,2020-12-03
1,Definitely don‚Äôt do their job protecting my nose,"I don‚Äôt recommend these masks to anyone. Mind you, I have an average sized, adult face. They fit so loosely near my nose and kept falling downwards as I talk. The whole purpose of wearing a face mask is to protect your nose and mouth from droplets ... these are not worth it and I highly recommend buying elsewhere.",US,2020-08-02
1,Too thin; costly mistake,"This mask is too thin. I can see through it. The ear straps are very flimsy. I can see no way this mask could possibly be effective in Covid protection.

Maybe it could be used as a general dust mask or as protection against large particle contaminants.",US,2020-10-19
1,inside is the same as outside,The Xl size is awsome but my only concern is both sides are very similar and it is easy to confuse the front part to the back part hopefuly you dont accidently infect your self by doing so,US,2020-07-01
1,DON'T BUY!!!,Hate to say it...BUT these masks suck!!! I'm definitely allergic to whatever they're made of...my cheeks are bright red & burning after wearing mine several times today!!! They're hard to breathe in...feel like I'm gasping for air while wearing and my face just keeps getting hotter & hotter!!!,US,2020-08-14
1,Began tearing the first time worn,I wore the mask for 20 minutes and noticed right away that it could hold up for just 20 minutes. Just normal wear. Clean shaven no reason for snags or anything to cause the mask to immediately begin to tear. Never washed just wore it once.,US,2021-02-02
1,Does NOT Work,The mask is so soft and unstructured that it slips down below the nose and must be continually repositioned. I will not reorder this product.,US,2020-07-02
1,Don't bother buying!!!,"Really poor quality, smells funny even after washing, does not fit around nose well, elastic strength too weak to be useful...., The price was way overinflated for the quality. Don't bother buying",US,2021-01-02
1,Ordered large a month ago and it‚Äôs not the same size as large now,My family ordered these exact masks in size large a few weeks ago and I loved them. I decided to order the exact same product in the exact same size and this current batch is much larger and falls off my face. That is really annoying and downright bad business practices. Now what? This batch is unwearable.,US,2020-08-01
1,Sizing guidelines are inaccurate,"These masks run small. I ordered an XL and based on the sizing guidelines, I was afraid that it might be too large. Quite the opposite... it is too small. There is no size tag on the mask itself, only a label on the packaging. So I guess it's entirely possible that an L (or maybe even a M) sized mask got put in a package labelled as an XL.",US,2020-10-30
1,Not recommended,"The 3 masks were inconsistent with one another. Each was a slightly different shade of dark gray. The stitching was also inconsistent, one mask was stitched so poorly that I threw it away because the fabric was very bunched up in the center. These masks are also extremely hot! Not breathable fabric whatsoever.",US,2020-08-09
1,"Do not buy, not breathable","I‚Äôve tried many cloth and disposable masks and I would NOT recommend these masks. It is hard to breath, not sure why the description sounds it‚Äôs breathable when it‚Äôs not. I wish I could return them but I washed them before testing them out.",US,2020-10-10
1,Doesn't pass the candle or light tests,"You can blow a candle out wearing this, while you cannot blow a candle out when wearing a disposable surgical mask. You can also see light through it, while you can't with a disposable surgical mask. I wouldn't recommend.",US,2020-10-12
1,slides off nose when I talk. Exhales into my eyes.,There is no nose wire. It leaves a gap between my nose and cheeks that I can put my finger through clear down to my lip. Exhalation goes directly into my eyes. When I talk the mask slides off my nose after two or thee sentences. A seven dollar mask should have a nose wire.,US,2020-10-20
1,Single layer,"Maybe I didn't read the description close enough but these are so thin, I would not feel confident wearing them. They are a single layer of material so will continue to wear my other 3 layer masks and skip using this one.",US,2020-08-22
1,dont buy these..too small..i retruned them and they keep re charging me ..,dont buy these..too small..i retruned them and they keep re charging me ..,US,2020-09-13
1,Bad quality,"After using for less than eight days, the strap broke this item is not worth ill suggest for you to find another one.",US,2020-08-18
1,Garbage,"These don't fit for squat, they either fall down off your nose, or ride up above your moth! Total garbage that I threw into the trash. Not even worth the trouble of returning!",US,2020-12-06
1,Way too big for youth!,I bought the youth size for my kids and they were way too big!,US,2020-08-22
1,WAY TOO BIG...RIDICULOUS,"Bought both adult sizes and ended up with MULTIPLE SIZES! THEY WERE ALL HUGE! Both orders came with a mishmash of sizes, none of which fit the adults in our household. Going to break out the needle and thread and size these big boys down. Only 2 can be resized, one out of each order...ridiculous.
Soft, silky material. Would be great if they fit your face.",US,2020-08-07
1,they are not suitable for a three year old,Way way too big for a three year old. They are adult sized. Not accurately described. Waste of time and money for kids.,US,2020-07-22
1,I found them useless,"I did not like the material. it's so thin/soft that when I breath in my mouth and talk, the mask moves in and out of my mouth..very odd. There is no metal around the nose to shape around your nose, so my glasses fog up as soon as I put it in.",US,2020-07-22
1,no bendable nosepiece,These don't seal around your nose. Look elsewhere for protection. I ended up going to target. I got two for about 4 bucks WITH A BENDABLE NOSEPIECE. Stay safe.,US,2021-01-08
1,Nope,"We are told that if you can blow a match out through the mask, the mask will not stop anything from coming in.
You would think the three ply mask would work.
These do not.",US,2020-08-12
1,NOT GOOD!!!,Not what I was expecting and definitely not worth the money. Guess I will keep looking. Need to look at the ones made here at home. Sizing was not good either. Very unhappy üò° with this purchase,US,2020-08-15
1,Flunks candle amd light test.,I was easily able to blow a candle out. Does not pass the test and is useless as a barrier to a virus. Also flunks the light test. This mask is at best eye candy.,US,2020-11-01
1,Waaaaay too small...,I ordered 3 XL masks. The three that arrived were smaller than the typical paper masks! So small they wouldn't fit under my chin and cover my nose! The typical paper masks fit better. Mistake in shipping? Maybe. But if you want XL masks - look elsewhere.,US,2021-01-28
1,Slides Too Much,"While comfortable and soft, the pronounced absence of a moldable strip above the nose makes these very easily slip down, defeating the entire purpose of wearing a mask. Cannot recommend.",US,2020-09-24
1,I can't breath,"These things are nice soft material, but the material is thick making it too difficult to breath. Could not use these at all. Also, they were too small.",US,2020-10-31
1,Smaller than Advertised,"Don't be confused by the images in the listing. I ordered the XL size specifically because it says it is 6"" tall but the masks I received are barely 5""",US,2020-09-12
1,Useless...there is no wire.,"I needed a large or extra large mask. The little KN95 masks pull my ears off. So I am forced to wear the disposable blue ones. Wanting something more substantial I ordered these. They are large and soft, but without a wire they are useless. The air races past your nose steaming and clearing your glasses. Effectively offering ZERO protection!",US,2020-08-12
1,Nothing near XL in size,"I ordered these in the XL size. They barely cover from the edge of my chin to just above my nostrils. Also, the ear straps are so short they are painful to wear. If you have a large head, don't waste your money on this product.",US,2020-07-26
1,"Small, not X-Large",Complete waste of money.,US,2020-07-12
1,Don‚Äôt waste your time or money,"Elastic is too tight, not enough give so it pulls on your ears. The material is thick so good protection but 100% got and uncomfortable. Never even used the mask after 1 day of attempting to use. Not like I am going to send back 2 unused and 1 used mask. Waster my $$",US,2020-12-25
1,Weak elastic gives out fast.,"While the size initially seemed perfect for my husband‚Äôs head, after gently washing and air drying a few times the elastic has given out and the masks no longer provide any protection.",US,2020-08-13
1,Overpriced,Not very protective. Big gaps around nose and side of mask would allow aerosol virus particles through easily.,US,2021-02-01
1,Not Covid compliant,"This looks and fit great. I was so disappointed it didn't pass the COVID test. If you can blow out a match while wearing it, you know it doesn't work.üò≠",US,2020-09-05
1,Fogs Up Glasses,"Light weight, BUT NO NOSE WIRE and my glasses fogged up constantly. Ear loops are soft, but thin, and after a few hours, started to irritate the back of my ears. I won‚Äôt buy again.",US,2020-11-02
1,VERY VERY PAINFUL FOR YOUR EARS. I BOUGHT XL.,Don't waste your money. There is no way you can wear this for more than a few minutes max. Overpriced. They are trash for me now.,US,2020-08-18
1,Did not receive 3 of the same masks.,I received 3 masks. Two were the material shown in the photo one was a different material. I will return.,US,2020-09-17
1,Small and large are same mask,"Ordered large, way too big for me, but for husband we‚Äôll. Then Ordered small, same exact size. Now o have 6 masks that don‚Äôt fit me.",US,2020-08-04
1,They fit larger faces.,"I did not get the blue ones, they were delivered but I did not get the pkg. the reason I gave it 5 stars is because I got the black and white ones and they fit a larger face. Very soft best ones so far.",US,2020-08-25
1,3 Ply ???!!! Nope!,"The mask is lightweight and soft. Problem is it is described as 3 play...it's only 2 ply. There is no opening to insert a filter. Very disappointed and will probably return. Also there is no nose clip so between 2 ply, no space for a filter, and no nose clip if offers very little protection.",US,2020-09-06
1,Elastic broke first day.,Elastic broke same day of receipt on one mask. Not good quality. Would not recommend.,US,2020-11-22
1,The worst,"Stay away from theses, they are smaller then advertised and they smell even after a wash with Dref. I cannot wear theses.",US,2020-08-06
1,Cheap rip-off junk,Cheap grocery store check-out line $1.99 junk. Insanely overpriced. Just junk.,US,2021-02-05
1,You can see holes in the fabric weave when you hold it up to the light. Useless.,You can see holes in the fabric when you hold it up to the light. Useless.,US,2021-02-04
1,Not reusable!,Don't waste your money. The material is rough and not for re-washing.,US,2021-01-31
1,Not recommended,It will not hold int place - this thing keeps coming down below my nose,US,2020-10-27
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality, straps on two masks detached after a few usages",US,2021-01-28
1,Inconsistent Sizing,"Second order of same mask, and huge variation in the XL size. I threw my second order away. Not even close despite package labeled XL.",US,2020-09-27
1,Buy n95‚Äôs,Overpriced cloth. Look for a quality assurance label. N95 keeps 95% of particles out. This is like wearing panties over your face.,US,2020-09-05
1,Earloops cut my ears,The earloops are so thin they cut my ears.,US,2020-12-13
1,Might be OK if you don't have a nose.,Just a flat piece of cloth made to look like a mask. No nose. No chin.,US,2020-11-16
1,Horrible sizing,Way too big! The ear pieces need to be adjustable. They are too loose.,US,2021-01-17
1,SHOCKINGLY unbreathable,"SHOCKINGLY unbreathable, i was breathing my own hot breath back in. Are the reviews bogus? Either that or they received a different product.",US,2020-11-02
1,"Tiny, see-through masks","I'm not sure what size human could wear these. The masks I received, I don't think would cover my dachshund. Masks were tiny in size and completely see-through. I threw them in the trash.",US,2020-11-05
1,XL just isn't big enough,"The reviews led me to believe these would be big enough for my large - but not excessively large - face. They aren't. The XL size is totally worthless. No returns, so it's just more money thrown away on too-small masks.",US,2021-01-01
1,Match,Could easily blow out a match while wearing mask.,US,2020-11-01
1,Zero protection,Not water resistant and offer zero protection,US,2020-08-19

1,No protection,Poor quality and not water proof,US,2020-08-19
1,Not good,Would not buy again.,US,2020-08-12
1,Eyeglass Fogger!,The worst masks I have for fogging eyeglasses!,US,2020-10-22
1,No stiffener for nose and loose elastic,These masks have no stiffener or clip so they won‚Äôt stay on your nose. It kept slipping off. The elastic is not adjustable either. I returned them for a refund.,US,2020-07-26
1,HOT,I have a number of masks and these are by far the hottest and thickest that I have tried.,US,2020-08-19
1,No good,Ineffective,US,2020-09-16
1,Cheap,"Quality does not match the price. The elastic ear support are as cheap as the paper masks.. when making a decision, cross this off your list.",US,2020-08-30
1,They are tiny!,I bought the Large. I have a normal sized head. These are designed for tiny people. Very uncomfortable and pulling on my ears.,US,2020-10-27

1,not a good design for face fitting,uncomfortable,US,2020-10-17
1,I hate this thing,For someone like me who has issues with claustrophobia don't get this. I tried it on and I felt like I was gonna suffocate on the spot and had to remove it .Even though it's my favorite color black and I thought that's fine might like it make it used to it. No good for me it may work for other people but I've been working with the mental health therapist for years and she's trying to get me used to this mask stuff I find that the gaiter and bandana ones work better for me than these ones these were too they felt kind of thick and I didn't care for that not easy to breathe through that's for sure.We don't really work well in the summer which is when I tried it I seem to make you very A lot harder than what year with the humidity too it's terrible. I didn't like these I'll let my husband try them but if he don't then I'll probably just re home then the somebody that can use them.,US,2020-07-05
1,Smaller than standard paper disposable masks. Nowhere close to XL.,"I've been using standard size paper disposable masks at work as they provide them to us. However I've a large face/head and a full beard, so I decided to order some larger washable masks. These are absurdly small, significantly smaller than the free paper masks.",US,2020-06-12
3,"Smells, candle test passed, sunlight test failed","Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I read reviews about this mask not passing the candle test. I tried it myself. I don't see how one can blow a candle with this mask on. The sunlight test was concerning though. I did see one too many sparkles... Also the mask smells. Not sure if that's the soap residue, but I don't think so.",Canada,2020-09-12
3,Sizing confusion,"Sizing is very confusing. If these are really Enerplex masks, then why is amazon‚Äôs size DIFFERENT than the Enerplex website‚Äôs??? Went with Amazon‚Äôs recommendation of Large as it states it fits most faces, but found they were much too big. Wanted to exchange for smaller size but had to pay for shipping again. Had to use needle and thread on them to manually fit my face.
Other than this, masks are really soft, light and comfortable. Would have given this a 4 out of 5 but for size and colour issues: colour is not really permanent. Slight discolouration upon each wash.",Canada,2020-08-17
3,Mask May Not Be the Size that You Ordered.,"I ordered 3 packages of different colours, all size large. The white and black packages came one day. The blue package came several days later. The blue masks were much larger than the white and black masks. The size is shown on the package but there is no size label on the masks themselves. Obviously one of our packages is a different size, but we cannot tell which package had the wrong sized masks because all three packages indicate that that the enclosed masks are ""large"". So ... my advice is to see if your mask fits; if not it may because the wrong size was sent.",Canada,2020-11-10
3,"Okay, but XL is not XL, and I received different sizes in one package","Face masks are fine - they are a step up from the cheaper variety you will find on Amazon. I ordered the XL size, but they should not be called that - they are Large as compared to most other brands I've tried. Also, I ordered the 3 mask package in XL, but only 2 of the 3 masks were the correct size, and one was much smaller and doesn't fit.",Canada,2020-08-09
3,comfy,"I bought 2 sizes XL & L, for my husband and myself. The sizing for XL is spot on and comfy to use but i'm not sure about the other sizing. From the size chart, i was meant to be a large and the large ended up being too big for me, i couldn't return cos i needed it urgently",Canada,2020-08-19
3,Comfortable but a bit itchy,"There is no metal band at the part where it crosses the nose, so your glasses will fog up, and that means that you do not have a good seal on your face. It is well made, easily washable, comfortable to wear and is three layers deep, all woven though. Better masks have a non woven layer for better filtration. I found it became itchy despite the fact that the fabric is soft and a comfortable fit.",Canada,2020-12-11
3,"Meh. Better than the paper masks, but needs work.","They would be better if they had put a metal piece above the nose to create a better seal. I cut mine open and shoved a wire inside, it works. Comfort of mask is ok - i dont have a big head so I got the medium size, and they seem a little too small. But workable. They can be quite warm and uncomfortable after about fifteen minutes indoors. Outdoors they work as a great wind breaker in the winter.",Canada,2020-12-09
3,Tissu int√©rieur difficile √† respirer / Pour courte dur√©e seulement,"Masque tr√®s confortable. Ne tire pas les oreilles . Par contre,
L'√©paisseur du tissu qui se trouve contre la bouche (l'√©paisseur int√©rieur) est en coton doux , mais ouf, difficile √† respirer √† la longue. Je le conseille seulement pour une petit sortie (√©picerie de courte dur√©e, d√©panneur etc) mais malheureusement je l'ai essay√© 3h au travail et non.... De plus, le fait de respirer , la bouche cr√©√© toujours de la condensation habituellement normalement tol√©rable mais avec ces masques, le coton int√©rieur devient facilement '' humide'' √† force d'expirer l'air de la bouche. Un peu d√©sagr√©able, c'est pour cela que je conseille plus pour un usage ce courte dur√©e.",Canada,2021-01-27
3,Large is too small,"I bought the large size and am disappointed. The cloth is soft and seems of quality but I look like dumbo the elephant with my ears uncomfortably pulled forward with the elastic strings straining. It also just barely covers my chin and nose. If you have a relatively large face I would not recommend, even if you order the large size.",Canada,2020-12-09
3,"Great for small amounts of time, bummer for extended time periods.","At first the mask seems fine, but wearing it in any sort of heat (summer), and/or for an extended amount of time gets really uncomfortable. Super hot and steamy... Plus when you breath the mask is heavy enough that it sucks in on your inhale. Wearing it for short periods is fine enough though. (5 hour shift serving at a bar, no. Half hour trip to the grocery store, sure).",Canada,2020-08-17
3,Super comfortable and light,"Exactly as described, and fits my face perfectly. It's comfortable enough to almost forget it's there, because of how light it is. However, I took off a couple stars because I wish they extended the elastic to the nose bridge portion, or even added a wire nose bridge. There is a not-so-insignificant nose bridge gap with these, which impacts how effective the mask itself actually is.",Canada,2021-02-05
3,Inconsistent Sizing,"I do like the style and softness of these, but the sizing is quite frustrating. All 3 masks have a different shape/fit. One was slightly smaller in length from the nose to the chin so it tends to pull down a bit more when talking. One gaps open under the chin. One has excess fabric in the front because of the cut of the fabric (a more pronounced curvature). And I had to tie a knot in the ear elastics of all 3 to prevent them from falling off my face because they were too loose. I also wish that they had a wire in the nose for a more secure fit, so I will probably try buying a different brand next time.",Canada,2020-08-27
3,Received wrong size.,"Ordered a pack in Medium size, after checking the measurements. While finishing ordering, the basket showed the item was youth/small adult. Tried few times by emptying the shopping basket and chosing the right size ‚ÄòMedium‚Äô, which would populate my basket without giving correct size info. Getting tired, I ordered anyways. Order received on time, size on the inside package marked as small. I had to wash it before trying for size verification. Sure enough, it‚Äôs a bit smaller. Medium size would have been perfect. Be Careful when ordering. The system should NOT fill our shopping basket with a different size if size required is out of stock. Stuck with something that can‚Äôt use.",Canada,2020-08-17
3,Large is smaller than expected and I'm a small guy,"These masks are made for very tiny, tiny, tiny people. I'm a normal sized white guy with normal features, including normal sized head. And large is way too small, even my wife's is too small for same order. XXL would be more appropriate, but not available.",Canada,2020-12-07
3,"It‚Äôs too big, won‚Äôt shrink, and it is very hot to wear it all the time","I measured as per guidelines, and ordered size L (which is the smallest adult size). Still the mask is too big, the ear straps are too long and loose, they are not adjustable. The mask is soft, but breathability is below average ‚Äî after a period of time it is too hot inside the mask.",Canada,2020-08-16
3,Not pleased,"I am not pleased with these masks because the product description says that they can be shaped to your nose size, but these masks can not. Also the elastics have expanded with just about four wears.
I do not recommend these masks.",Canada,2020-09-03
3,Slips down my nose,"When I first put this mask on I thought it was quite comfortable. However, after wearing it for about 5 minutes I found that the portion of the mask that covers my nose kept slipping down. This issue was especially prevalent if I talked while wearing the mask, but even if I was just walking with my mouth closed it still constantly kept slipping down my nose. I consulted the sizing guide prior to purchasing so I don't think this issue is related to mask size/fit but rather the fact that this mask *does not* have a flexible wire around the nose portion.",Canada,2020-11-11
3,Be sure in your measurements,mask meets all the specs as advertised except the size. I measured and re-measured to be sure I selected the right size. Unfortunately my masks are too big. I tried one and it fell below my nose. I shortened the earloop but that only distorted the shape. I suggest measure carefully and maybe go the next size smaller or be very sure about the size.,Canada,2020-08-26
3,XL is not very XL,"Even though I purchased the XL sized face masks, I find once I start talking my nose very quickly pops out over the top of the mask. I have tried positioning the mask higher on my face, as well as flipping it over in case 1 way sat better than the other, but it keeps happening... and my head is not gigantic or anything.

Right now, no-one wants an embarrassing nose-tip slip when they are in a mandatory ""masks on"" situation, so its a little disappointing",Canada,2020-09-09
3,"Good mask, but concern on QC","Awesome masks, very comfortable and breathable. However, one of the three has torn apart ear loop after FIRST TIME use. So I am not sure with the durability of the material or quality control of the product.",Canada,2021-01-14
3,XL was too big,I thought having a bigger face to order the XL but they were way too big. It did not hug my face as right as I would like so I am going down a size. They weren‚Äôt bad with respect to eye glass fog and breathable,Canada,2020-10-28
3,"Black ones perfect, blue ones inconsistent","I ordered 3 packs of the black ones in a size medium and large, and they were fantastic. Super comfortable and lightweight. However I ordered the blue ones in a size medium yet the masks were super inconsistent. One was a size large even tho it came in the medium pack, another had longer ear straps, and only one was actually normal. This issue was only with the blue ones, not the black.",Canada,2020-08-29
3,Not for people who wear glasses.,"Quality is okay. Ear straps are a bit on the short side. There are no wires in this mask and therefore air blows upwards and fogs my glasses, no matter how I adjust the mask or my glasses on my face.

If you don't wear glasses these masks are fine.",Canada,2020-10-02
3,Not bad...,"These masks arrived very quickly. Yes, they are light but hold in more heat than my vented ones. They also lack an adjustable nose wire.

Beyond that, they do the job. Just not great if you wear glasses.",Canada,2020-10-22
3,These are NOT. XL,These are not XL. They measure the same as a med my daughter has. Cheap ear pieces and simple do not cover face,Canada,2020-08-05
3,"OK, would only recommend if your in a pinch","Just your average cloth mask. Easy to wash, soft and doesn‚Äôt hurt the face. Don‚Äôt know how effective it is against the covid, but beats using a blue disposal mask. Only complaint, is if you wear glasses they do fog as there is no nose piece.",Canada,2020-08-15
3,Good masks but sizing is off,"I ordered a set of these masks in Large and quite liked them, so I ordered another pack of Large masks and a pack of XL ones for my partner. However, the second set of ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù masks were much larger than the first pack I ordered. They seem to actually be the XL size, but they were in a package that said ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù. I would like more if these masks, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm willing to just hope that the right size in the right packaging comes next time.",Canada,2020-10-15
3,Only ok.,My 14yr old likes these. They are soft and feel nice but they do not have a nose wire and they tend to slip down your nose a bit. They don‚Äôt feel as thick as some other masks I‚Äôve tried. I did not do a candle test.,Canada,2020-11-11
3,Comfortable and good fit but...,I've been very happy since I received these Monday August 17. I've been wearing them most days traveling and working and they've been very comfortable even with my big head. I've washed them each twice (not noticing any shrinking) but just noticed the stitching coming off on one mask already at work. I'll double check the other 2 when I get home but hopefully this is an isolated incident.,Canada,2020-08-27
3,It's okay,"I liked how easy to breathe it was but unfortunately if you ever have to talk to someone, it slides off your nose. Maybe it was a size issue but it's the only mask I have that constantly slides down.",Canada,2020-11-11
3,White large size smaller than black large,"Beware. While these are comfortable, the white large are considerably smaller than the black large. I bought both and the white are less comfortable. If you overlay the white on black the size of the white is definitely smaller.",Canada,2020-11-16
3,Inconsistent Sizing,"I liked the thickness of the fabric and the softness. However, the sizing is inconsistent. One of the three masks fit me, the others were way too large. I would suggest sizing down. I ordered according to size chart and measurements.",Canada,2020-11-28
3,Large is not really large.,I like the texture and colour. I measured and used the size chart and purchased large size but they do not fit. Too small. The other large ones I purchased from another seller fit fine. Gave these to my grand kids.,Canada,2020-11-04
3,Slightly too big despite being within specifications,Earloops are flimsy. Slips off when talking more passionately - could be just me. Might want to consider sizing down if you‚Äôre on the lower end of specifications.,Canada,2020-11-11
3,Good but not great at the gym,I bought these for the gym since reviews mentioned breathable / good exercise. They aren‚Äôt. They are decent masks for general wear but not the gym.,Canada,2021-01-27
3,did not meet expectations.,Unfortunately material caused noticable irritations to the cheeks of the wearer. Not suitable for individuals that have sensitively skin.,Canada,2020-08-04
3,It‚Äôs okay but the fit around nose is not great,"The fabric is very soft, however, the fit around the nose is not that good. It‚Äôs a little loose and my glasses fogged up every time I wore it.",Canada,2020-09-12
3,Too big for my face,"Nice fabric, but it‚Äôs too big for my face.. Tried to return it for the smaller size, but they won‚Äôt except them.. NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN!!!",Canada,2020-11-30
3,softNcomfy,"XL initially too big and large moved around too much when talking. Washed them all and tightened the string a bit on the XL and i've got a really nice fit now.
only concern is the elasticity of the string.",Canada,2020-09-10
3,Well constructed but Hot,"Comfortable Material to wear, Sizing is small, So Up size as others have said. I find them Hot after wearing them for over an hour,",Canada,2020-10-04
3,Very light but comfortable.,"Not sure how effective but very comfortable and soft. Fit is good and soft, but the mask has a tendancy to slip down.....adequate not special.",Canada,2020-10-29
3,Have no nose wires,"The material is nice. Size is also OK, but the lack of nose wires makes the mask is not suitable for the cases you need to speak with surrounding people or wearing glasses.",Canada,2020-12-11
3,1 of the 3 masks can't be used,"Overall an OK mask but one out of the three masks I received in the set has bad stitching which causes it to collapse inward, making it basically unusable. This is extremely frustrating when you expect to get three usable masks :(",Canada,2020-09-26
3,"Good,","Wrong size, but I returned it and bought large, great product overall, but wrong size. The brand contacted me saying how they wanted to give me a free 3 pack of L masks for free because of the inconvenience. They are super sweet! Thanks!",Canada,2020-11-14
3,Bon produit,"Confortable, l√©ger et doux. On est √† notre 60 √®me lavage, le tissu est encore bon. J‚Äôen ai achet√© pour ma femme mes trois enfants et moi.",Canada,2020-11-15
3,Runs large,This is a lightweight and soft mask. I feel it‚Äôs a bit warm and is big for my face. I bought a large but I guess a medium should be enough.,Canada,2020-10-10
3,"Good mask, sub par elastic.",These masks initially have a great fit and comfort. The only problem was that the elastics very rapidly began to lose strength and get stretched out. It appears to return slightly after washing but noticed a big difference in the fit after only a few washes.,Canada,2020-09-10
3,Not too bad...,Much smaller then shown on line .would recommend a larger size for adults..wash well before use however a bit afraid to put in dryer due to potential shrinkage.,Canada,2020-11-20
3,Great masks but earloops ripped after first wash,Would have loved to give these 5 stars but 2/3 of the mask earloops ripped after washing and drying according to the given instructions. I love the one mask that remained intact but disappointed that that the other 2 ripped after first wash.,Canada,2021-01-11
3,Almost Perfect,"With a size-adjusting bead and longer ear straps these would be perfect.

Size of mask is ideal but way too much pressure behind my ears. Gives me a headache.",Canada,2020-11-24
3,Review,"Fit and quality is good, not great the only thing is the bands are too loose for adult or youth size they keep falling off. I wish it had adjustable bands. I just tied a knot to shorten the bands length for my kid and it works fine. If your kid is wearing glasses it will fog up.",Canada,2020-09-24
3,Face mask,These are ok no nose piece don‚Äôt feel the three layers just seems like one layer. A little disappointed in product,Canada,2020-12-01
3,"Very comfortable, but warm.",These masks are very soft and comfortable to wear. But it gets warm in those things. We found out that the best for breathing is still the disposable ones.,Canada,2020-08-15
3,Run large,"Excellent quality, but run large. I ordered the adult size first, then the youth. Even those were too big. An expensive mistake, as I know I can‚Äôt return them. ‚òπÔ∏è",Canada,2020-11-23

3,"Thinner than expected, missing a must have",These are thinner than expected and do not have a flexible metal noise piece built in.,Canada,2020-12-01
3,Size issues,"I followed the sizing chart and measured it as directed for my kids which indicated a large. I thought that was odd for kids, but ordered it as indicated. Sure enough the 5"" measurement for kids is wrong. The ear loops are much to loose.",Canada,2020-08-28
3,It's okay,It's not amazing. I wasn't blown away but I guess its better than the blue masks.,Canada,2020-12-06
3,Don‚Äôt listen to the sizes,I have an over all 3 on this because the ear straps need to be a bit tighter I had to put a loop in them so the mask fits my face properly if not for that 5 stars,Canada,2020-08-24
3,"Not breathable, very hot",The masks get very hot. Not the most breathable and leave an odd odor on your face. Nice fit but otherwise it‚Äôs average.,Canada,2020-11-27

3,Love them but,I love them but regular N95 masks are easier to breathe in,Canada,2021-01-23
3,Not for big noses.,"They‚Äôre soft, but it feels like a sweatshirt covering your mouth, a little too thick, and if you have a medium to large nose, they‚Äôll be uncomfortable. No Nose wire either. They‚Äôll do for quick store runs but I wouldn‚Äôt want this all day.",Canada,2020-08-18
3,EnerPlex Youth mask,"Bought this for my child who went back to school. He says it works and is ok. The only downside is the size, a tad too big. Also, I think it is a bit pricey should be cheaper.",Canada,2020-09-22
3,Nice reusable cloth mask,It a bit warm wearing it but it fits well and is comfortable.,Canada,2020-08-12

3,Hard to breath through. Otherwise comfy,All masks such. Hot to hard to breath in this one but comfy,Canada,2021-02-03
3,"Fit large, thick material and not very breathable",The masks fit large and are quite thick. I found them not very breathable and I would get very hot under them. Ok to wear for a short period but way too warm to wear for a longer period and indoors.,Canada,2020-09-25
3,Meh,These will make you glasses fog like crazy. They are comfortable. But they are warm.,Canada,2020-09-12
3,Not one size fits all.,These masks will only fit snugly if you have a large head. The straps are not adjustable or tight enough to stay on a smaller face comfortably. Otherwise they are quite nice.,Canada,2021-01-08
3,I would recommend to bigger noses.,The product didn‚Äôt fit my face very well as there was a lot of space between the mast and my nose. Not meant for my small nose but the material was breathable.,Canada,2020-09-20

3,Good value for fabric masks,"This set of three masks is decently made. The fabric is average. I do have a much finer weave fabric mask with a lining that is harder to breathe in (which is good in terms of safety).

I like this style of mask that goes under your chin. It's more secure and the shape helps to hold the sides closer to your cheeks. This also goes high enough up the nose to stay covered while you speak.

I prefer masks that secure behind your head like a blindfold. I don' tknow why that's not more common - it's way more comfortable than earloops.

The one comment I'd make is to think carefully about getting black masks - they draw heat and it's already hot wearing a mask!",Canada,2020-07-26
3,Very THICK material,I could hardly breathe in these. I feel they are too thick. I stopped using them for work (which was why I purchased them) lol. I only wear for short period like going to store. If you can manage the thickness then it is very fineü§ó,Canada,2020-09-18
3,Not What I Expected,"Overall it is an okay product, but actually I don't feel as protected so will not be using it as often as my disposal surgical masks. It is very lightweight, soft and comfortable but I need more protection from COVID 19. I think it is as advertised just didn't realize that the disposal masks offer more protection. Thus the 3 star Average Review.",Canada,2020-12-02
3,Not adjustable,Nothing really wrong with this product but only giving three stars as they are not adjustable,Canada,2021-01-14
3,"Comfortable, but not sure how effective","These are comfortable but thin-ish. Cannot adjust the ear loops. No nose piece to make snug there (although is shaped quite well do does fit pretty good over the nose). Cannot add a filter. Now, with new guidance on better masks, this is going to become our 'over the real mask' cover. Will add an extra layer, and is a nicely made, just don't think it's what it really required to stay safe. For a mask cover, or maybe on their own and being outside, this is okay, but I wouldn't be wearing these for long durations indoors with other people.",Canada,2021-02-02

Sinon, une fois lav√©s, tout va bien, assez confortable (si un masque peut √™tre confortable)",France,2021-02-05
3,Comfortable But Failed the Flame Test,"Pros:

I live in New York. So mandatory masks has been going on since April. I have tried so many masks. These masks are very comfortable. Fits perfectly. I got a large and feels wonderful. Comfortable. Breathable and Stretchable.

Cons:

Failed the flame test. If you want to know if your mask is doing a good job protecting you and others. Get a lighted match. Put on the mask and cough much as you can. With this mask I knocked out the flame on my third try and the flame goes everywhere every time. That means micro droplets can fly out your mouth and into the air and vice versa.

Conclusion:

These masks feels good but in the protective category it is troubling. Best bet is to double up these masks. I did that and the flame never moved. I can still breath and feel comfortable with two on. Or combined with a surgical mask they sell at the pharmacy. Wearing these singles is risky.",US,2020-07-14
3,Too Big!,"I got the size large because that's what it suggested for normal size adults. I guess I'm not ""normal"" sized. I should have got a size medium instead of large. The large is just too big on my face and there is a huge gap under my chin so it doesn't feel like it is protecting me like it should. I should also mention it was still too big after washing and drying it and trying to shrink it. Which it did shrink a little bit but not enough. It is soft and comfortable but does not feel protective and foggs up my sunglasses when I wear it.",US,2020-07-21
3,Different size masks are the same size ear to ear,"I like almost everything about these masks.

Only the height of the mask is different between the S, M, and L masks. The distance from ear to ear is exactly the same which is frustrating as I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and buying different sizes if I had known that.

The small fit my thin 8 yo boy fine for height but I had to tie a slip knot in the ear loops so the mask will stay up. I may consider racking them with sewing thread after we figure out what size will be comfortable for a full day a camp.",US,2020-07-23
3,Soft feel but no nose wire! :(,"These are probably the softest masks I've experienced yet against my skin and I was SO glad to find a company that does actual sizes! Especially since my husband needed an XL for his beard. SADLY THOUGH, there is no nose wire!! GAH!! It would have been five stars, raving from the rooftops if so! But sadly, it does not, which gives a lot of space above the mask for air to get in and out and I was CONSTANTLY having to pull it back up when talking bc it would slide down below my nose...which defeats the purpose of not touching your mask and keeping you safely covered at all times. I also got a set for my husband who works out a lot outside, hoping it would be a more comfortable option, but alas, he had the same issues with it sliding down and said it was HOT to keep on outside. So I guess the take away is if you don't care about the nose wire, you won't be speaking in it, and you don't need it for outside, it is a good option. (I do highly recommend, however, that the company makes it clear that there is no nose wire in the mask. I did hours of research and when I got to these, I thought my prayers had been answered because it looked so structured, I assumed there HAD to be a wire in it.) :(",US,2020-07-21
3,Im keeping but would not order again.,"These are soft and comfortable but a little difficult to breath in. I see people complaining they are not 3 ply. I doubt that because if they were any thicker, you would not be able to breath. My complaint (besides they are hot) is that they have no metal strip to conform over the top of your nose. My glasses are continually fogging up. Because of this I would not recommend to eye glass wearers. I will keep for family members but keep looking for me.",US,2020-07-17
3,Not for Glasses Wearers,"These do not work for me at all, because there is not a good seal around my nose and my glasses fog up immediately. Glasses wearers need a bendable nose piece to create a good seal and these do not have this essential feature. I give them 3 stars anyway, because these masks would be OK for people without glasses. I wish I had read the questions.",US,2020-07-19
3,"Not optimal for us, might work for others","Nice quality material, really soft and well sewn. Horrible smell; I'll wash and see whether that mitigates it. Ear straps are super comfy and it conforms to face well other than the height, i.e., its main problem is that it doesn't cup down under chin, or if you try to make it do so, you pull it down off nose. This is for a medium size. I think a contributing problem is not having a wired portion for the bridge of the nose. Even if it had that, however, mask would still be too short to fit our 12-year-old or me--I'm about same size (5'3"" small boned female) although with different face shape. Way too short to fit our older teenager or my husband. If I can get the smell out, i'll consider buying a size up, although lack of wire might be a deal-breaker since there's no significant elastic anywhere to help keep it on (i.e., the material itself is a knit, which gives it some stretch, but that's not enough on its own to keep it up). First thing is to get rid of the smell . . . and i'm not really that sensitive to smells; this one is just that bad.",US,2020-08-11
3,Nice but looks like underwear,"I made the mistake of getting the white masks. While they are comfortable and fit well, they look exactly like underwear. It‚Äôs basically like wearing a jock strap.",US,2020-07-21
3,Has the same problems as masks in general,"This mask is comfortable to wear, importantly 3-ply and fits quite well since it is formed at the top to fit over the nose.
However, it suffers all the usual problems I have found with mask wearing; it rides down, exposing your nose, when you have a conversation, it causes glasses to fog up and it's hot and sweaty if worn in a warm humid environment.
There is no metal to conform and hold it tightly over your nose. I have added a strip of adhesive bandage along the entire top edge, but found that has limited benefit in stopping my glasses from fogging up as the still vapor blows out in all directions through the material like a leaky balloon when exhaling and the bandage hurts to pull it off! That does help to stop it riding down though. It seems like the top half, middle ply should be non-porous material to limit the upward movement of moisture-laden breath, with a bendable metal strip.
I would say these masks are nothing special, but they do do the job and are well-made. Hopefully a time when we can go out mask-less is not too many months away.",US,2020-12-24
3,Amazon wont tell where its made???,"Amazon must of removed the locations of where products come from. I used to only order American made but they removed where all their products are made. This one is from Vietnam. It's easy to breath through and a nice mask, but still I was unable to easily support American made product because they hid that info.",US,2020-07-29
3,Great masks - edit: didn't pass candle test,"I'm really happy with my purchase. The mask is very soft on my face and is more breathable than the previous one. They're easy to wash/clean and seem durable so far, I've been wearing them for a couple months. The main reason I chose this mask was because they had great sizing options and weren't one size fits all. I'm a petite woman and the Youth/Adult Medium fits perfectly. It's snug (not tight) and covers the area from the middle of my nose to a little under my chin. I rest my glasses on top of the piece on my nose to prevent fogging. If I need more masks I'll definitely repurchase these.

Edit: I lost a couple of these and was going to repurchase, but then I found out about the candle test which this does not pass. I really loved these masks, but now concerned about the level of protection they offer.",US,2020-10-25
3,"Great fit, looks great, not as advertised.","The reason I purchased these masks were for an all day outing at Universal Studios, where they are currently requiring all park visitors to wear a mask. I live in FL, and I knew what to expect with our weather in mid July. I wanted something comfortable and breathable, hence the reason I chose this product based on review ""Breathable Comfort"". So you might be asking, why three stars? I was really hoping and leaning into the keyword 'Breathable' here. And they are no less breathable then any other face mask I've worn. Definitely not as breathable as the generic hospital masks you get for free when you visit your doctor. This is the reason for the 3 star review. It's just not any breathable than any other face mask I've worn. Based on just that, I would have given the product a 1, BUT I didn't because this product does have some other qualities that outshine other masks I've worn. They do look good when worn compared to other masks. They're very comfortable, I wore the mask for probably 7 hours straight that day, on hour 6 and 7, my ears wear getting sore, but I stretched out the ears straps a bit, and it was back to comfort. If I was to give this manufacturer an award, I would award them the 'most fashionable' mask. I should also throw in the fact that I HATE masks. Before they were mandated by grocery stores, theme parks, etc, I never wore one. So if you are those people that have been wearing masks (voluntarily) since the beginning of the pandemic, you might think it's breathable ;)",US,2020-07-29
3,"Add 3/4"" if you want to talk while wearing","Measurements do not take into account trying to talk with these masks; for this and all other non-pleated masks you should add the distance your mouth opens when you talk (about 3/4"" for me) else the mask keeps slipping off your nose or chin.

Could use a wire on the nose as well.

Overall I find the disposable masks with fabric folds that can expand when you talk much superior to these non-pleated masks.",US,2020-08-05
3,Couldn‚Äôt breathe well & shrinkage,"For me, even after following wash instructions exactly, these have shrunk way too much. Also, they are way to think for me & I was hoping for breathe ability. They may work great for some. The quality of workmanship is very high as far as fabric and sewing.",US,2020-07-09
3,Ear loops needed adjusting for adequate fit on young children,"The face covering part of these is a great fit for my 3, 4, and 6 year old. The problem is the ear loops. They are too big, causing the mask to droop which creates completely inadequate coverage. To fix the issue, I tied the ear loops in a knot, which fixed the coverage issue, but creates discomfort for my children‚Äôs ears.

I know they make little plastic things you can use to adjust the size of the ear loops, but I didn‚Äôt want to have to purchase something extra. These masks are decently priced, but I ended up purchasing others that are comparably priced and don‚Äôt require adjustments or the purchase of ear loop adjusters.

The material of these masks is soft and breathable, and if your children are older or have larger faces, they may work. I would recommend them maybe for older children or suggest that if you want to try these, buy the ear look adjusters as well.",US,2020-10-02
3,They don‚Äôt stay put.,"These are comfortable, soft masks, but they don‚Äôt stay on my face. They keep sliding down forcing me to adjust the mask constantly. They are also not consistent in size. One fits my face well, the other 2 are much smaller and barely cover my chin. I have a small face so this size should have been ok for me. Washed them before wearing them as recommended in the instructions. They pass the test of blowing a match, too bad they don‚Äôt have a nose metal strip that can be closed to prevent breath from escaping from the top and fogging glasses. Although the thickness is fine, I don‚Äôt feel protected wearing them because they slide and air escapes from the top.",US,2020-12-22
3,Very Comfortable - wish there were more colors,"This is one of the most comfortable masks I've gotten (and I've tried many). What would make it perfect? If the XL was a bit bigger. The size different between L and XL is barely noticeable - less than 1/2 inch. If it came in more colors (like a darker blues/greens/teal/charcoal gray or even purple would be nice. Have to be very careful about where we put them to keep mine and my husband's apart when they're all black, and I don't like the pale blue or white). Thinking of bleaching patterns on them to tell them apart, if I can do that w/damaging the fabric. I'm also thinking of adding a filter pocket... though not sure how that will affect the comfort. Adjustable straps and metal nosepiece would be nice, but seems can't get everything I want in one mask.",US,2020-09-14
3,Odd smell after washing,Product looks good. Washed in laundry & put in dryer for a bit. Tried on & had a weird yucky smell. Rewashing by hand. Anyone have this problem? Please advise!,US,2020-07-01
3,I still get air blowing into my eyes,"The mask is cool looking, but it suffers from the same problem as every other cloth mask. It doesn't fit snugly around your nose and you get air blowing up into your eyes. This could be solved by inserting some sort of rigid wire into the nose portion of the mask, like disposable masks, I'm not sure why no cotton mask has fixed this problem, to my knowledge. I have some other cheap cotton masks that I bought for like $0.50 a piece that I stick a paperclip into the top portion in order to make them keep their shape, and then I just take the paper clip out whenever I launder them. I continue to use that method rather than these more expensive ones.",US,2020-12-22
3,"OK, but lack of a fitted nosepiece compromises seal. 5-star customer service","This mask is OK, but it lacks a moldable, semi-rigid nosepiece. This means that plenty of air enters over the nose. I have a goatee and find that because of the lack of a nosepiece, as I talk, the mask is pulled lower and lower. I would classify this as a comfortable modest safety upgrade from a bandana, best for someone interested in comfort and compliance, but not very worried about protecting themselves.

Edit: The seller, Mayfair, went out of their way, both before my review was posted and after to ensure my satisfaction, with no requests or suggestions to alter my review. They simply wanted to be certain I was satisfied.",US,2020-09-27
3,comfortable but need to constantly adjust,"These work well as long as you are not engaged in a conversation with someone. They are comfortable to wear and do not pull or hurt the ears. However, everytime I start talking, the mask gets pulled under my nose and I constantly have to readjust ... which means you are constantly touching the outside of the mask with your hands and as someone who works in healthcare that a big NO NO as you are now spreading the germs from the outside of your mask all over the place. I mostly use these masks when I go to the store or walking through ""common areas"" of places and typically do not engage in many conversations, so for the most part it fits my needs.",US,2020-08-06
3,Durable but hard to breathe through,"Nicely packaged and well sewn. Launders easily. Would have been 5 stars but for the fact that they are difficult to breathe through. Exhaled air goes up into eyeglasses and fogs them. I recommend these only in cooler climates for the young and healthy having no glasses or breathing problems.

UPDATE: The seller of this item went out of their way to contact me several times regarding this review. They offered return and replace options to correct this issue. Despite my rating of the product, my rating of the seller is 5 stars.",US,2020-09-12
3,Strap broke after only a few uses,"My husband is an essential worker who must wear a mask daily, so we rotate through a set of 6, which means he wears each one no more than once a week. We purchased these less than one month ago and one of the straps already snapped while he was wearing it. He'll use the others until they break, but we won't purchase this brand again.",US,2020-09-18
3,Quality mask... but needs a XXL size,"I like the mask, the material fells good and it‚Äôs not that hard to breathe out of.... my main issue is that the mask could be a little bigger to fit my face. So maybe a XXL would be perfect.

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5 and 300 lbs. and when I wear the mask, the top portion of the mask sits right in the middle of the bridge of my nose which makes it uncomfortable for me and hard to talk without constantly having to readjust the mask. Also the straps that loops behind the ears pulls kind of hard on the cartilage on the back of my ears.

So I believe increasing the size offered for this mask would correct this.",US,2020-08-14
3,"Great mask, go X-large if you‚Äôre 5‚Äô9‚Äù or better.","UPDATE - I received an e-mail regarding my satisfaction of the facemask. I mentioned the sizing as per their chart wasn‚Äôt adequate. They‚Äôre sending X-Large. Fantastic follow up ! Great service ! Right off the top, throw out their sizing recommendations. If you‚Äôre 6‚Äô go for the extra large, period. Material is nice, seams are nicely finished. Good breathability. Wash them before initial use. As for comfort, I don‚Äôt find any mask by any producer, comfortable.",US,2021-01-24
3,Laughably Undersized,"I've ordered three sets of these and can confidently say that are laughably undersized. The ""small/kid size"" ones that I received looked like they were meant for a child under age one. I ended up giving the large ones I ordered for myself to my 7 year old, and they fit him almost perfectly. I don't have a particularly large face or head, but even the XL ones are just slightly too small to fit without tugging and pulling down when I talk, but luckily I always wear two disposable masks under my cloth mask. Would not recommend these to anyone.",US,2020-11-12
3,"Good, sort of...","I bought the XL and it is incredibly comfortable and breathing is easy. The only reason for three stars instead of five is that there is no wire across the nose bridge. It doesn‚Äôt make for a secure fit and if you wear glasses, the lack of a secure fit means your exhalation causes your glasses to fog up.",US,2020-08-07
3,Comfortable but not as breathable as they say.,"Ordered these because they said they were light weight. While they‚Äôre super comfortable on your face, they are not easily breathable. I have to wear a mask for most of my workday with safety glasses on my face as well. They‚Äôre better than many of my masks as far as not fogging up my safety glasses but my face is unbelievably sweaty with them on. Don‚Äôt buy if you have to wear a mask all day long, not bad for just a quick trip into the grocery store though.",US,2020-08-17
3,"Nice large size, covers well. Definitely not breathable.","I ordered these to throw in the car for when I forget to grab my regulars and these are by far better than the disposables but after 15 min of wearing this, you are ready for a break. The material is just to thick to wear for very long. I was happy about the size, it covers the areas most masks don't. I wasn't constantly pulling the mask up over my nose. The ear elastic was comfortable too, just needs a thinner material for breathing.",US,2020-10-06
3,"Good Quality, but Needs Nose Clip","I bought these to have a breathable face mask with more polyester or spandex material than cotton. When I received them, they seemed like they were quality masks. However, there is no metal nose clip so there are gaps around the material on the bridge of my nose. I don't like having the air I'm exhaling going into my eyes as it's irritating, so these masks didn't work for me. Aside from the absent nose clip, they seemed like quality masks.",US,2020-08-23
3,You can blow right through them,"The face masks I make don't allow for much air to be blown through. These, you can blow a candle out when blowing through them. They are soft and comfy-, the ear loops are fairly cheap. One of them was already falling apart. That being said, they are soft and stretchy.",US,2020-07-08
3,An OK mask,"I liked the shape and style of these masks. The material is somewhat soft and comfy enough against my face for all day use. I am a bit hesitant on the type of protection these masks offer due to the material being slightly see through when I held a flash light to it. I ordered an adult large which seems to be the standard size but it's a bit loose on me. Especially when I speak for a long period of time, the mask seems to slide down my nose a bit. Would be a big plus if these masks had a nose clamp and we're a bit more fitted.",US,2020-07-29
3,Decent bur no nose bar,"Works well and convenient 3 pack. Ear loops are a little small and I'm an average size male (5' 10""). Because there is no nose bar, if you wear glasses you will fog up. For that reason I only use them for working out at the gym because they are comfortable. 3 stars only because of no nose bar.",US,2020-11-19
3,Almost perfect!,"While this fit well on my face, my wife did not have such a good fit. A 3 pack is nice, but if the masks are only needed for limited time, its better to sell a 3 pack of assorted sizes for families.",US,2020-11-30
3,There is no wire for nose,"There is no wire to tighten across the bridge of the nose, and it fits loosely. I had to tie the ear loops on the child's size to tighten it some, but it still was loose around the nose and there was a gap at the sides.",US,2020-07-15
3,Not what I expected,"I bought these because there were favorable responses from others who bought them. I wore one the day I received them and it was soft and comfortable. However, after I found I was touching my face frequently because anytime I talked the mask pulled down. There is not a nose clip to help it stay in place. I returned them the next day.",US,2020-09-04
3,Not so comfortable,"These are very soft and ""Comfortable"" based on softness alone but they are almost too soft. As a result, they tend to cling to your face to the point that it does not allow any gaps or air to flow in and around your mouth and nose.. I like the soft feel but there needs to be some sort of stiffer shell to keep it from clinging to my mouth. I can't wear them as a result and obviously cannot return now.",US,2020-09-21
3,Comfortable but not really breathable.,"Pretty comfortable mask, it's very soft and the elastic doesn't pull my ears too much. However, it's not very breathable. Although it's not as bad as some other masks, it still restricts the airflow significantly compared to no mask. Comparable to breathing through a cotton t-shirt stretched over your face.",US,2020-11-22
3,"Nice material, but SO HOT","With our family being very careful during this pandemic, I have ordered different masks for us to wear for grocery trips, etc. This mask feels great for about 3 minutes, but it is SO hot...for me, unwearable for more than 5 minutes. Too bad, since it looks and feels nice....both my son and husband agree, it‚Äôs like wearing a ski mask :(",US,2020-07-27
3,basic reuseable masks,"Ok masks, but very basic, only to be used in a pinch. No filter pocket, no adjusters for the ear loops, not even a nose wire. I have small, slender face, I was worried at first they were a little too big. They kinda fit ok, but I would feel way more comfortable with a nose wire, since that's where the gaps are.",US,2020-10-05
3,"Expected better, but not bad","This masks are are soft to the touch. But i have to say they are not comfortable as it expected i had to be fixing my mask into place various times throughout the day, and it did start to bother my ears after a few hrs. Nonetheless a good mask. Because it does feel as if it protects.",US,2021-01-14
3,I ended up returning. Masks fit small.,"I wasn‚Äôt a fan. I ended up returning these. They didn‚Äôt fit my face well. And yes I took measurements beforehand. I am a man, 5‚Äô11‚Äù. I have a reasonably sized nose and a slightly large head. I ordered the large size. This mask went from the bridge of my nose and didn‚Äôt make it under my chin.",US,2020-11-26
3,"Like all others, when speaking my chin pulls it off my nose.",I have a long face (but I wouldn't say I'm deformed or anything!) I have yet to find a mask that will stay on when I speak. I was hoping the XL would have enough height to stay on my face when I talk. It does not. My chin pulls it off my nose. Other than that it's a great mask.,US,2021-01-23
3,Those straps!,"The mask itself is fine. It's a good size and the material quality is fine, but the straps are small and weak. They barely hold the mask in place. I checked the five different styles of face masks we have and these are far and away the weakest straps plus they are put on the largest masks.",US,2020-09-16
3,way too big for 7yr old.,"Waayyy too big. Bought the youth size (Sm) for my 7 year old. It was so big, they gaped on each side away from his face. I also bought a pack size LG for myself and there is little difference between both sizes. Plus side, now myself and my husband have masks and they are very comfortable. Downside... now I have to purchase kid masks again....",US,2020-09-15
3,Sizing is wrong,"These are very nice masks. However, the sizing is pretty off. I measured according to the photos with a soft tailor measuring tape and then selected my size accordingly. It's way too big. I ordered a medium for 11 year old son (his measurements said he'd need a medium) and they are too big for him. I'm an average sized woman and they are too big on me as well. I'll probably try ordering the small size because they do seem like nice masks but it's very frustrating to have to go through the ordeal of returning them, especially right now.",US,2020-09-01
3,"Soft, comfortable, and a little big for small faces.","Big for little faces (4year old) had to add some beads to the ear elastic. 4 year old wears it so it is soft and comfortable. Very thin though and makes me think it probably is not much better than not wearing a mask. Still, at least we look compliant wearing the mandated mask.",US,2020-09-13
3,Comfort > utility,"These are super-soft, very comfortable masks (as long as you get the correct size--they run small, so most men will need an XL). However, they don't seem to provide much ""stopping power"" for coughs/sneezes (you can feel it on the outside), and they are useless if you have to wear glasses (fog city!). But if you just want a mask so that you can comply with various mask requirements, this is very comfortable.",US,2021-01-17
3,"Doesn't fit well, my glasses keep fogging up","I've been using disposable masks ever since the COVID crisis started. Decided to try some fabric masks. These don't fit my face well and the elastic around the ears seems to be weaker than it should be.

I'm going back to the disposable masks. Lesson learned.",US,2020-09-30
3,Size down,"Just FYI, I measured my face as recommended and used the sizing chart that is pictured. According to the chart, I was a medium. Just got them today (a week earlier than expected, which was nice) but they are way too big. I would definitely size down. I will have to put little rubber bands around the straps in order for them not to fall off my face. I do have a small head, but that is why I used the size chart. Bummer.",US,2020-09-13
3,Not for people with Glasses,"Overall the material and softness are good but because they do not have nose clip, there is small air opening around the nose and fog up my glasses. I would not recommend it to people who wears glasses.
Also not sure whether it is safe for Covid-19 since you have the opening around the nose.
I cannot use it and plan to return it.",US,2020-10-13
3,Worth a try,Overall they fit pretty well but after a while the material does get a little hard to breathe in but it does not fog my glasses which is important and they are comfortable. I need to shrink the one my son uses because it will not stay up on his nose but overall they are pretty decent,US,2020-07-22
3,The youth size is too short between the chin and the nose.,"I bought these for my son to use at school. He is a very small 14 year old, and they‚Äôre still too short when measured between the chin and the nose. I constantly catch him wearing it under his nose because when he talks it pops down.",US,2020-11-21
3,Meh,XL fits perfect for my face. It's definitely soft but not breathable at all. It gets very hot,US,2020-12-03
3,Weird fit,"These are a good size for teens or adults with a smaller face, but their shape seems almost molded, so that it puffs out over the nose and mouth area and looks truly bizarre and is probably an ineffective air filter. I had to return them.",US,2020-10-08
3,"The mask is good, but...",The mask is a good fit. Material is pretty thin. Often questioned if I am protected. Needs a mark to show which side is up. Would be great if a filter could be a used with the mask.,US,2020-08-17
3,Great product but straps broke after one wash,"I got this product a couple days ago and I just put them through the wash tonight. I tried them on when I first got them to see how they fit and they're so comfortable. I just wish I could have actually worn them at work. I put them through the wash and dryer exactly as its instructed but one strap on each mask snapped and broke off. I'm thinking I probably should have went with my gut and just washed them by hand instead. I would love to recommend this product but with the straps just breaking like that, they're useless.",US,2020-08-16
3,"Nicelooking and comfortable, but comes apart after a single washing",Nicelooking. Comfortable fit. But...after a single pre-wear washing...the inside layer of the double layered mask is separated from the edge of mask stitching. You need to stitch these leaving extra fabric above where you start your stitching.,US,2020-09-11
3,Comfortable but Hot,"These masks are very soft and comfortable, but they are hot and I feel the cost was a bit high. I ordered a friend these as well and she agrees that they are comfortable but hot. I would not recommend them for this reason.",US,2020-12-01
3,Move along.,I can‚Äôt wear these for long without moisture collecting inside. They are hard to breathe in. I keep going to touch it to adjust. They are made well and I got what I paid for. I just can‚Äôt wear these for any longer than a quick trip inside.,US,2020-08-17
3,Okay Project for Okay Price,"It is nice and better than the disposable masks, however it fits lose on my face and I had the impression it has a nose wire to mold to your face. In a pinch it works, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth the almost $19.00 though.",US,2020-06-11
3,More comfortable than paper; less comfortable than other cloth masks,"Material has a strange polyester feel and even after washing, smell. Was very hot when worn outside on a summer day. More comfortable than paper masks, but not nearly as comfortable as some of the cotton ""dust"" masks with carbon filters. The XL is barely large enough for my husband's face.",US,2020-07-09
3,"Good quality, sizing runs small for my medium sized face.","Mask was purchased as a response to COVID protection guidelines. Mask is well made. The sizing was an issue for me. I ordered and wanted a medium sized, adult mask which should be larger than a small. However, the mask is sized as a small/medium, no difference. The next size large/extra large would have been much too big. Although more costly for the seller and subsequently for the purchaser, I would recommend manufacturing four individual adult sizes - small, medium, large and extra large. Thank you.",US,2020-08-09
3,Update,"Update: I figured that if I turned the nose side downward to my chin, the mask would stay on. Customer service was nice.

Original: Falls off the nose when you talk, uncomfortable on the ears. I would return it for a refund if I could.",US,2020-08-03
3,"Thin, no filter pocket","These face masks fit my 11 year old very well. They have 3 layers of cloth, are soft, and light weight. He found them to be very comfortable. The problem I have with them is they seem thin, there is also no pocket for a filter.",US,2020-08-04
3,Comfortable but looking worn too soon,"These are comfortable for those who have to wear a mask all day at work. They're soft. However, they're looking worn a little too soon. I've had them about 6-7 weeks. I bought a total of 6 so each one is worn, washed, and hung to dry once a week. The fabric is looking faded. Great if you're looking for comfort but don't expect them to look like new for very long. My Old Navy masks are holding much better but aren't as comfortable.",US,2020-12-19
3,Restrict breathing,"I gave 3 stars because the are uncomfortably hot to your face and restricted my breathing.
There is no nose strip to seal tightly above the bridge of the nose to help seal the opening there. No filtration and fogs up glasses.",US,2020-08-04
3,Not so XL,"I've tired multiple masks. This one is a pretty average size. I suppose the cloth over your face is larger than normal, but the space from ear to ear is no larger than any other mask. And, there is no elasticity in the ear loops.",US,2020-07-22
3,"Too small for my big face, otherwise very nice","These masks are really good and soft and nice to wear all day. Unfortunately, they are too small for me. They fit side-to-side, but not from nose to under my chin. I was hoping that since they‚Äôre labeled as xl they would work, but they don‚Äôt.

If you don‚Äôt have a large face or beard, these would be great.",US,2020-10-23
3,Slips off nose,"Still a bit big for a teen/small adult. Daughter uses only when doing outdoor activities and needs something to put on to make those around her comfortable as we pass. I'm pretty sure this doesn't protect at all, but that's ok if outdoors.",US,2020-09-06
3,"Description says XL, I received Medium",Three quick things to note. The masks are soft. The ear loops are not adjustable. These masks do not accept carbon filters. I'm returning because the description says XL and I received Medium.,US,2020-11-20
3,So disappointed,"Ordered these masks in a large according to how to measure for this product. When received they were way too big for my face. Thought sure with virus they couldn't be returned so I washed and dried hoping they would shrink. Unfortunately for me, they did not. Superior quality, incredibly soft but still to big for my face. Still need masks for protection but now I have none.",US,2020-07-13
3,Medium: From ear to mask too large!,"Ordered for our 12-year-old son and we measured according to the chart. The actual mask fits OK Though a bit large but from ears to mask, it is way too large. That size is made for an adult or really large youth.",US,2020-08-09
3,Wont stay on my nose,"It's soft, comfortable but keeping it up on your nose is a challenge. If you do pull it up then it is almost in your eyes. Maybe a wire on the nose would help, otherwise I liked it a lot",US,2020-11-18
3,No metal nose strip,"Masks are soft and ear loops comfortable. However, the absence of metal strip means that the fit around the nose is poor thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of the mask due to a coverage gap.",US,2020-11-21
3,Check size before opening,This is my second order. The first order was great. This order contained the wrong size (smaller) and they didn't fit. I should have double checked the package before opening. Disappointing.,US,2020-12-10
3,Okay,"The masks fit well and seem good quality, but the dye is heavy and makes them stiff and not as usable as they could be with less of it. I washed them in hot water and detergent, that helped, but still would be better with less dye, or no dye.",US,2020-07-23
3,They seem to work upside down,"When you put this mask on and put the bent side over your nose, it will slip down immediately and ALL damn day. Finally I turned it upside down and put that part under my chin, and it works fine. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to work. I did like the modified size for my little narrow face (I am an old lady).",US,2020-09-03
3,"Too small for my head, thick and difficult to breath through",I have a big head. These don't fit me at all. My kids have smaller heads and since these are not adjustable don't work for them either. The material is too thick to breath through easily. I won't buy these again.,US,2020-07-29
3,Ehh,These masks are just ok. They don‚Äôt feel very secure on my face and there is no tightness on the bridge of my nose as there is no rigidity or clip. I feel like plenty of air is making it in around the edges. Probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend! Still searching for that perfect mask.,US,2020-07-20
3,No Noise Strip to form a seal and prevent steaming of your glasses,"No Noise strip to form a seal and prevent steaming of your glasses, not pointed out in their description!
I guess the are lighter because there is not steel strip LOL - not a great mask",US,2020-09-16
3,Not really smaller,"This is a perfect light weight mask. I have wear in for 12 hours and my face doesnt get irritated. I only gave three stars because I order a medium assuming the mask itself would be smaller. It appears the mask is the same size as any other mask, but the ear pieces are just shorter/tighter. I have a small face and was hoping this mask would fix the problem of me have to readjust the mask ever two seconds. It is comfortable but still takes up more than half my face when I wear it.",US,2020-11-19
3,Best for kids 4 or 5 and up,"I have three boys and These fit my 6 & 7 year old great, they are too big for my 3 year old though, and he doesn‚Äôt like it tightened around his ears to try to make it fit. So not 5 stars cause of misleading marketing.",US,2020-08-09
3,XL too big,"The XL masks are HUGE and float in my face. Not comfortable or practical. Thankfully, one of the three is a smaller size that fits reasonable well, so it wasn‚Äôt a complete loss.",US,2020-10-18
3,I had to return mine. Gives me a bad headache.,"These are Amazon Recommended, however, I found them difficult to wear for longer than 15 mins. I did follow instructions when I received them by hand washing and air drying. However, I've wore them now 4 times and each time I got a piercing headache. I am returning them.",US,2020-07-21
3,Too Small,"I took measurements prior to ordering. I measured 5.5‚Äù so I ordered Large. I should have ordered Extra Large. When I open my mouth to talk, the mask is pulled down from my nose, rendering it useless. Now I have two untouched masks which will never be used. The material is very soft and seems breathable; just be sure to order a little larger than you‚Äôd think.",US,2020-11-22
3,Works But Sizes Run Toward Small,"The masks seem well made. They are soft and easy to wear. However, I ordered what I thought would be a man's large. It did fit, but seems a bit snug. If I ordered these again, I would order a size larger than what I thought I would need.",US,2020-07-13
3,Sizes are very confusing,"Hard to figure out what size you should order or even once the product arrives, what size it is. The bag says both ""M Size"" and ""Youth/Adult Smal..."". I tried to order an adult Medium...",US,2020-12-20
3,I just can't stand the fit.,"I dunno, some people really seem to like how these masks fit, but for me even though I got the size they recommended based on my measurements it just isn't comfortable. I can't open my mouth at all or it slips uncomfortably on my my nose and chin, and it won't stay in place. It's just the wrong shape for me, I guess. It's too bad, because the material actually seems pretty nice. Maybe it'll be better for you. I can't really recommend it though.",US,2020-09-14
3,Masks Are Functional But Could Ne Better,"These fit as described and will do the job of a mask but - the synthetic material collects odors from breath to those in the environment. They don‚Äôt breathe as well as cotton material, and if you have a beard the synthetic material rises down your face as you talk - leading to constant readjustment. They‚Äôre functional but inferior to natural fibers - this the three star rating.",US,2020-09-07
3,Narrow elastic bands; buy it a size up,"Nice material inside and out, with two layers of cloth. However, the ear straps are just narrow elastic bands that look like they‚Äôd be uncomfortable pretty quickly, and the sizing chart results in too small a mask by at least a size.",US,2020-09-26
3,Too hot,They're just okay. I don't think I'd buy them again. I really wanted to wear something besides the blue doctor type masks so I got these. But honestly they can be a little uncomfortable at times and they also make me REALLY hot.,US,2020-08-08
3,Too big for me,"Unfortunately they were way too big on my face! I‚Äôm an adult woman with a slightly chubby face so that was a little disappointing. They are comfortable though, I wish they would‚Äôve worked for me!",US,2020-10-20
3,Slide around a lot,"This mask was great the first day I wore it, but now that it has stretched out, it slides all over my face. I'm also constantly having to adjust it and put it back over my nose.",US,2020-09-14
3,Super cool looking,Got these for my bf and they look really nice honestly. He did say he had a little trouble breathing compared to the medical face masks but that was the only issue!,US,2020-10-15
3,Large enough for a large face.,"Was so glad I had purchased these. Finally tried the mask and was pleasantly surprised. It was large enough, for my face. Which was half the battle. Will update after prolonged period of wearing.",US,2020-12-06
3,Could have had adjustable ear pieces,"I like the comfort and shape, but there is be nose shaping in it and ear bands not adjustable. They are good, just got them, so we will see if they hold up.",US,2020-11-05
3,"Very loose fitting, great in all other areas","My only issue with these masks is their fitting. I‚Äôm a grown man and they came very loose. As soon as I put it on my face it fell down below my chin. I couldn‚Äôt imagine them fitting properly on anyone, let alone a woman or child. My recommendation would be to cut the strap and tie it like a shoelace, then cut the excess string. Once you do this, though, the mask is great! Very comfortable, stylish and breathable. If the manufacturer can fix the sizing, this will be a great mask without any personal fixing.",US,2020-08-22
3,OK masks,They are a little loose and don't cover my nose/mouth as well as some of the other masks I have. No wire loop in the nose area to snug it down.,US,2021-01-03
3,"Not big enough for my 8"" Fitted Hat Size Head","I don't see what all the hubbub is about. $18 for three 'XL' masks and it still doesn't fit me properly. I can either cover my nose, or cover my chin - never both.

For the record I am properly an 8.25"" in fitted hat sizes, if you're familiar with that size scale. Not overly fat or anything in the face, either, I am 6'2"" 200lb.

Doesn't solve the problem I was hoping to solve.",US,2020-10-05
3,They work,I got these but gave them for my daughter to use at work. I personally don‚Äôt like how it feels on my face. Something about the fabric.,US,2020-12-28
3,Masks are different size then the first time I ordered.,I ordered the medium size a couple weeks ago and received a perfect face fitting mask since I have a relatively small face. So I ordered it again and received a much larger mask. I double checked to make sure I ordered the same size and I did. But the masks were much larger the second time.,US,2020-11-12
3,"Runs very small, large not for normal size male face.",Small does not fit my 8 yr old. Medium doesn't fit a15 yr old. Large does not fit an adult with a normal to smaller face. Now stuck with a set of small that are for a toddler and have to find larger masks for an adult face.,US,2020-12-08
3,Not bad,Not bad. I have a bigger head and ordered the XL; a bit loose on the sides. So far no issues with breathing. It does cover nose to under the chin and I have a shorter beard. Covered it well.,US,2020-11-28
3,MASKS,"I was expecting to have an adjustable wire over the nose to tighten that area but no they not have. Hopefully when I am out walking with sunglasses, my glasses won't fog up.",US,2021-01-28
3,Hard to breathe and to large,The masks are very thick which is good for protection but it does make it hard to breathe and it does fit to large from the top of the nose to my adams apple. Fits around the ears perfectly.,US,2020-08-11
3,"Okay, don't get if you wear glasses","These don't have any sort of nose bar to keep your breath from gushing right up into your eyes, so if you wear glasses these might not be the best option.",US,2020-08-20
3,Too soft,"Too soft, tickles my face and nothing to keep the hot breath up in my glasses.
I do not recommend for anyone that wears glasses.",US,2021-02-04
3,Uncomfortable,Compared to many others I have bought these are much more difficult to breath in. They are right on an adult face with stitching don the middle that is irritating,US,2020-08-24
3,Update directions,"Okay but says white side worn inside well there is no white side both sides black so what side is worn out ,I went by the picture based on how the ear straps face .They need to change their directions on how to wear them",US,2020-10-31
3,Good but terrible sizing,Ok quality and softness. Unfortunate large is not large enough XL is too big. Would be nice if they had a semi rigid nose bridge to get a better seal and keep the mask up.,US,2020-10-21
3,Sizes are diff,They are good masks but these are suppose to be for kids but they are way big. I guess i could cut the strap but i figured it would already fit a child,US,2020-08-28
3,Overinflated reviews,"I bought these masks in order to avoid using excessively the disposable kind due to concerns for the environment. The reviews were glowing, but the reality is that they are very hot to wear, after a few minutes my face is sweaty and I have to wipe around my mouth frequently. I am fortunate that I only have to wear it when a client is in my office and not all day.",US,2020-10-21
3,Great for an adult but not a kid,My kid didn‚Äôt like them. To big.,US,2020-08-12
3,Lightweight but more condensation build up around mouth,Super lightweight and comfortable. I use during weight and cardio sessions. I like this mask but it makes my face sweat more.,US,2020-12-23
3,Very comfortable,"Super soft and comfortable. Ear loops very soft. Good coverage. However, it gets quite warm to wear, and wearing most of a full day at work does get warm.",US,2020-12-27
3,Too Big,"I am a normal sized female with a normal sized head. These are too big. I guess I should have gotten the medium size. As the pandemic is getting worse, I am now double masking when I can, so will continue to use these as part of my double mask.",US,2020-12-05
3,Decent mask but not for long periods!,"This mask is pretty large and fit well on my average guy size face. However, after wearing it for almost 11 hours straight at work, I realized it‚Äôs not the best. The thin and elastic ear pieces dig in to the tops of my ear and irritate them. For extended wears I decide to switch to a similar sized mask but with thicker cloth ear loops!",US,2020-08-17
3,Needs a nose wire,"I had to add a nose wire because without it, there's a big gap. Would be nice if the ear loops were adjustable too.",US,2020-12-26
3,Comfy but hard to breathe in.,"While this mask is soft and comfortable, it is not useful for exercise. It sucks into your mouth and nose as your breathe, making it very difficult to breathe properly when breathing heavily. I used it while at the grocery store, and the mask was comfortable enough. It‚Äôs fine for everyday use, but not for running as I had hoped.",US,2021-01-13
3,Bad madk,I hate it. To big and to heaven. Hard to breath with. I only use it now if I have to spray paint. They are useless for everyday.,US,2020-10-05
3,"Rubber stretched out, poor fit","Openings around nose, etc, ear loops stretched out within the month, not ready to breathe through. Worth it to buy a higher quality.",US,2020-09-06
3,Sizing issues,The large is just too big for me-adult female.. I'm going to end up cutting the band then tying it to shorten it so it fitses snuggly.,US,2020-11-27
3,Still recovering!,"They block downward view. Tripped on curb twice & to the hard sidewalk I went. Thankfully no broken downs, but plenty od bleeding! Sent to trash!!!",US,2020-08-09
3,Thin,"You definitely should NOT use this mask in a large group, because it‚Äôs so thin. I did the lighter test, and was able to blow the lighter out with the first try. It‚Äôs probably good for a small office setting that require masks.",US,2020-09-11
3,"Well made, comfortable.",Made well. Comfortable.,US,2020-06-22
3,Straps aren‚Äôt adjustable,Cute and comfy BUT... falls off nose. The straps are not adjustable!,US,2020-07-10
3,"Fit fine, but are mostly polyester","They fit well and are comfortable at first, but then feel real hot, probably because they are mostly made out of polyester.",US,2020-07-22
3,Poor protection,2 out of the 3 masks failed the flame test. I was able to blow out a flame easily.,US,2020-09-03
3,Pretty small,"Ordered large, seemed to be the default. Next time X-large, Could double as a bra cup! That's what it reminds me of anyway.",US,2020-08-01
3,Run larger and make you a sweat,They are nice mask but run on the larger side . They also seem to keep heat in as it feels warmer on my face than other masks and makes me sweat sometimes .,US,2020-10-15
3,Great quality but inconsistent sizing.,"The masks are exactly what I wanted. My mom and I have had such a hard time finding masks that fit our faces. We were so pleased we ordered another pack in the same size but the second package of the masks were significantly bigger.. that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not rating 5 stars, so happy with the first three we ordered but sad we couldn‚Äôt get more in the same size for some reason.",US,2021-01-24
3,Worth $5.00 not $16.00,"Decent masks, but still cheaply made. Woth five bucks max. $16 for 3 masks is robbery.",US,2020-11-25
3,The aren‚Äôt comfortable,They came in different sizes even though I bought the same size. Two are smaller and so tight. They are soft though.,US,2020-10-12
3,Sizing was not consistent,"I purchased these masks for my son to use at school. I ordered a size small and one of the masks was way smaller than the other two. It barely covered his nose and mouth. They seem comfortable, but just disappointed that I basically paid this much for just two usable masks.",US,2020-09-02
3,rather not,not for me. Be better if it had the nose clip when I breath my breath comes out at the nose into my eyes,US,2020-08-12
3,Decent at best,"This product at first seems great, the issue is in the material and the string around your ears. If you wear it for long periods of time it hurts. Facial hair pulls on the materials as well",US,2020-08-19
3,Medium Quality,I would've preferred a higher quality so I wouldn't buy again.,US,2021-01-08
3,really hot,I find these make me hot in a hurry because there is limited breathability. Wash up well.,US,2020-10-09
3,Accurate sizing,These mask are good but disappointed because the large is very big. Description stated large fit most adults.,US,2020-08-04
3,Straps do not hold up,This is a very comfortable mask but I have to give it lower stars because the straps are cheap and break quickly. One arrived with a strap already nearly broken through and the same things happened to the other two after the first time I hand washed them. Too expensive for one time use.,US,2021-01-31
3,Broken straps,The ones that were not damaged worked fine. The straps were broken on several.,US,2020-10-04
3,Ear bands are too thick,"The mask was fine in terms of fit and breathability. My son dislikes masks with seams going down the middle, but I don't mind. We all agreed the biggest issue was the elastic part that goes behind the ears. It is quite thick and uncomfortable - and made of something that feels close to tshirt material. We prefer thinner elastic-type ear loops.",US,2020-09-24
3,"Comfortable, form fitting, but not easy to breath through.","Comfortable, form fitting, but not easy to breath through.",US,2021-01-05
3,"Large and comfortable, but difficult to breath through","I use these masks nearly every day and i used them at disney world. While they are comfortable, the material is not breathable and offers alot of resistance causing your breath to go out the top and steam up your glasses.

I strongly suggest a regular cloth mask instead.",US,2020-12-12
3,Not that comfortable,"Not as comfortable as I thought, but I don't wear a mask unless forced to at the few places I do shop. Wearing these definitely helps me get my shopping done faster, so I can get done and out and take this thing off. Not a fan of any masks.",US,2020-07-26
3,Disproportionate,"These are very well made, but they don‚Äôt fit well. I have 5 children ages 3-9 and they don‚Äôt fit a single one of them. If they fit comfortably across their face, they are too small to cover their mouth and nose.",US,2020-08-27
3,"Too big, no top wire to pinch over nose.","Soft and washes well.
But this is too big for my face, and there is no nose wire to pinch for a snug fit.",US,2020-12-09
3,Ear Ring very uncomfortable,They are soft but just okay for breathability. Ear peices uncomfy,US,2020-11-18
3,One of the thinnest,On the thin side...who knows if it actually works,US,2020-12-20
3,Careful what size you order,Don‚Äôt believe the size stated. The small might fit a 5-6 year old at best,US,2020-11-08
3,Sizes vary even though I ordered the same size,First set of 3 fit perfect. So I ordered a second set and they are too big. No consistency,US,2020-08-12
3,Masks are Ok,Ok for the price I thought the quality would have been better,US,2020-10-24
3,Not all the same size,"Out of 3 masks only 1 of them truly fits and stays on my face. I gave the other 2 away. They would slide down my face while speaking.

They are very comfortable, but it would be nice if they were all the same size.",US,2020-08-11
3,Buy smaller size for correct fit.,"They are loose, not cut well. I wear an xl motorcycle helmet and have a beard. These are still loose.",US,2020-11-24
3,Stretches,Stretches and then doesn't fit right.,US,2020-12-14
3,Causes face bumps,"Initially I loved wearing this mask, but after about a month of use (and daily washes) I started developing red bumps around my mouth and nose.",US,2020-12-30
3,Ineffective,These masks are soft and stretchy but they are too stretchy and thin to be effective. I would not rely on them for serious disease protection.,US,2020-08-12
3,Good quality masks,The masks are soft but i expected it to be very comfortable. One cannot wear this for consecutive 3-4 hours.,US,2020-09-13
3,Wish they were cotton.,Fits well but pretty fuzzy and slightly irritating. Not for long wear. Wish they were cotton. They‚Äôre some kind of synthetic fiber.,US,2020-11-23
3,"Very comfortable, BUT.........","This mask is very very comfortable and fits well BUT, it doesn‚Äôt prevent your glasses from fogging up. There is no wire around the nose piece to hold it down and stop this from happening",US,2020-07-22
3,To big,"They are to big, my mistake.",US,2020-12-31
3,NOT XL LIKE OTHERS,Not XL face covering. Gave to peeps with narrow face,US,2020-08-25
3,Inconsistent,I bought my first set and they fit perfectly ordered another set of XL face masks and they were smaller than my first set. * UPDATE* After posting that I had received the wrong masks they contacted me to make it right. After a couple of days I had a new set of masks at my front door and fit great.,US,2020-12-03
3,must have,"too big for me,a medium size woman,it keep slide down.",US,2020-08-09
3,Decent product,Decent product but runs pretty small,US,2020-12-04
3,Mask Cannot be washed in hot water.,The masks smell so bad they are almost nauseating.,US,2020-08-25
3,It‚Äôs ok,It‚Äôs light & comfy but doesn‚Äôt fit well.,US,2020-12-06
3,Uncomfortable,Uncomfortable elastic for ears. Not what I expected.,US,2020-09-11
3,lacks metal piece for nose,Does not fit tightly around nose because it lacks metal strip.,US,2020-09-13
3,There's no nose bridge metal strip. Leaks...,There is no metal strip on the nose bridge. As a result they leak around the nose. Not sure how effective the mask really is.,US,2020-11-11
3,Good mask but sizing inconsistant,"My 5 year old seems to like these for school. I bought the small size and tied knots in the ear loops to shorten them. I ordered a second set of the same size but the newer masks are a lot larger and they don't really fit his face, even after washing them.",US,2020-11-30
3,Easily stretched too loose,Not my favorite masks. The elastic stretches out to easily.,US,2020-08-06
3,Hot and shrinks,The black mask is very hot....they tend to shrink if washed in hot water and dried in dryer !,US,2020-08-06
3,Nice but too big,"These masks would be awesome as they are soft and very breathable. However, I ordered large and its way too big for me and my husband. I'm going to keep them and adjust the ear straps with my sewing machine. I would suggest sizing down.",US,2020-08-06
3,Not extra wide. Just tall,It tall for a mask but not really xl,US,2021-01-20
3,Fairly good-does not fit full face.,"The quality of the mask is very good, however the size is far from extra large. This mask will not fit a face with a beard of any kind even one that is very short and well trimmed.",US,2020-06-27
3,Doesn't fit 5 yo or 8 yo,"Otherwise it appears to be good quality. Thicker than I'd like, washes fine.",US,2020-09-11
3,So-so. Not a good fit. Collect moisture.,Poor fit. Have to be larger for an adult.,US,2020-09-15
3,Face mask,Cheaply made,US,2021-02-02
3,Pretty good,On the whole these mask are good. As a guy the facial whiskers (even tho I shave) tend to cause the inside material to become more fuzzy and make talking hard by the stray fibers.,US,2020-11-07
3,"Overall good, but thicker than I wanted!","It is very soft & comfortable. It is a little thicker than I wanted, but it works well. It fits right, but can be hot when working.",US,2020-08-03
3,No go for glasses,No flexibility in the nose so I can't wear them with my glasses. Always pushing or pulling or breathing funny. Soft material though and night be ok without glasses.,US,2021-01-02
3,Too small,"After two washes in cold and air drying they shrunk too much and are uncomfortable pulling on my wife's ears. She bought the smalls for our pre-K son, I tied the loops and they are perfect for him at school all day.",US,2020-10-03
3,Average,I got larges and they were WAY too big for me. I put them in the wash and dryer to try and shrink them but it didnt work. I think if they fit better I would like them but I ended up throwing them out.,US,2021-01-07
3,Wish there was a filter pocket....,"These are ok, they do have 3 layers, the material is durable and the fit my husband‚Äôs face well but there is no pocket for the to add a filter.",US,2020-07-25
3,"Absolutely garbage for glasses wearers, but good otherwise.",These are not within the realm of usable if you wear glasses. They will fog your glasses up unless you push the mask up and pinch the nose WITH your glasses. Otherwise they have good airflow and are fairly comfortable.,US,2020-09-03
3,Too big second purchase,Not very happy with my second purchase. The first time I bought them they fit right. The second time they are huge. Probably won‚Äôt buy them again from here,US,2020-09-21
3,Protection and coverage are important to me,The mask is perfect to wear as a covering over a surgical mask. This mask should never be worn by itself. it is too thin and it will not protect. The same as the surgical mask we buy in the store they are thin even the 3 ply. If you purchase this mask make sure you purchase the surgical mask to wear underneath it,US,2020-07-15
3,Ear Bands Broke,"Up side: These masks are comfortable and breathable.
Downside: After 1-1/2 months of daily use, hand washing and line drying, the ear bands of one mask broke, and the other two are already showing signs of wear and tear. I guess this mask is not made for everyday wear and tear.",US,2020-09-09
3,Small for a medium.,"It was a bit small for a medium. Fortunately, it fits at chin level.",US,2020-09-30
3,Hard to breathe through,Hard to breathe through,US,2020-09-10
3,Too large,"Unfortunately, These are too big for my 5 & 7 year old kids. I tried to tie knots in the elastic but that made them too tight and uncomfortable behind the ears.",US,2020-08-08
3,Disappointed - wrong size sent,"I am disappointed: I ordered a large and was shipped a small/medium, which I didn't even realize until the other day - I'd been wondering why they were so snug. They are much too uncomfortable and I also think pretty thick for exercise.",US,2020-12-26
3,"Comfortable material, but...","Disappointed. I got these thinking they would be easier to breathe in than the traditional disposable, but it‚Äôs actually the opposite. I think there‚Äôs something missing in the design. It‚Äôs hard to breathe in.",US,2020-09-04
3,Good but could be better,Wish there was a nose clip since they fog my glasses.,US,2020-10-17
3,size is a problem,"I ordered the blue and the white mask. I like the quality. and fit.
I ordered the black masks. they were small and of different sizes. I ordered again the black mask too small again.

i would like to talk to a person to describe what i want.",US,2021-01-27
3,Sizes vary per order,"Ordered two times, one pack and then two more - the two more are substantially smaller! Like a whole size step down. Very disappointed, these are great masks and not cheap but look silly when they don't fit right.",US,2020-11-01
3,Not Comfortable,Not comfortable. Rides up and didn't realize there is no wire over the nose. Does not stay in place and would never buy again.,US,2020-12-30
3,"If you think you know your size, buy the next size up!","Tight for a fat adult man, very well made! Fits my son perfect, I would buy the xtra large next time for myself.",US,2020-07-28
3,Not COVID-19 approved,It has a weird smell and isn‚Äôt soft. Also there is no metal piece or bendable piece on bridge of nose meaning it moves as you talk and doesn‚Äôt create a tight fit,US,2020-08-05
3,Material Separates after a few days,Giving it 3 stars simply because after using for a few days the material has separated (shown in picture). Also gets sore behind the ears but it is what it is. Overall good masks if they stay together.,US,2021-02-03
3,Not what I expected,Thin material,US,2020-11-05

3,Size not as advertised,I followed the instructions given by the seller to order correct size. They are are much smaller than advertised. It is a struggle to cover my nose and chin. I used their measurement suggestions to order.,US,2020-11-04
3,Ear strings will stretch out,"At first these were perfect and snug. But after about 3 uses on each one, without fail, the strings around your ears will stretch out so the mask will continuously slip down off your nose as you talk.",US,2020-10-05
3,Inconsistent.,"I would love to give these masks 5 stars, because 2 out of 3 are great. But the third one has oddly shorter ear loops and pulls/rubs on your ears the point of discomfort. I wish we could return just 1.",US,2020-11-19
3,"Big mask, little ear elastics","I have a large head, so I was happy with the fit of the cloth on my face, BUT the ear loops are too small for me and cause severe pain if I wear for more than hour.",US,2020-07-16
3,Child Vs Adult,"I ordered a package of child size and adult s/m but the child-size ones were larger than the adult ones, I think they mixed up the packaging. I need to order an additional bulk order but I want to make sure they don't get mixed up again.",US,2021-01-02
3,Masks,Masks suck,US,2020-12-05
3,it‚Äôs not the worst mask out there,it‚Äôs an okay mask if you really need one. not sure if it is covid safe due to the thinness of the 3 layers (my stubble was poking through so make of that what you will.) the xl was a tad bit loose on me but after 20 minutes of running errands a seam came undone so.... yeah üò¨,US,2020-08-17

3,Don't buy if you wear glasses.,"These masks are nice but they allow a ton of air to flow out the top of the mask so my glasses were constantly fogged. Very disappointed because I wanted a fitted, neutral colored mask.",US,2020-08-18
3,All were not the same,"Ok. Not anti-fog for glasses. If you are looking for that, skip these. They are comfortable and fit well, so if you don't wear glasses they are nice.",US,2020-08-06
3,Comfortable material,I like thicomfirtanles product; however material seems to stretch some during use and becomes too loose for my small framed face.,US,2020-12-14
3,sizing is off,"The masks are great quality, i like the shape and material, however the kids size fits me perfectly and Im a 33 year old woman. I've yet to find a mask marketed for kids that fit my 5 year old.",US,2020-08-26
3,Too bulky,Too bulky returned.,US,2020-12-28
3,"guality mask, bad ear loops.",very smooth and comfortable. But the ear loops stretched out way to easy after a 12 hr day at work. I had to tie knots in the ear loops to get them to fit again.,US,2020-07-28

3,Will do the job,Not a fan of the ear holes but they work just fine.,US,2020-07-18
3,Too big,"Masks were really well made, but WAY too big for my 5 year old. The product description says they fit as little as 3 year olds and this is NOT the case.",US,2020-08-24
3,Not as good as expected,Same as others but more expensive.,US,2020-09-26
3,Looks like a beak,These are ok. Not a real great fit though. Makes the wearer look like they have a beak in my opinion. Real soft though. Very breathable.,US,2020-11-10
3,Good quality masks but bad earloops,"The mask is comfortable, cool and breathable. But the earloops are too thin that make my ears hurt to wear after a while. I don't think I would buy these again because of the thin earloops",US,2020-10-04
3,Fog on the Glasses,"Soft cloths, easy to wash. Breathing is ok, only problem is fog if you wear glasses. A bit annoying.",US,2020-09-18

Cons: very warm compared to the surgical mask, fairly heavy for wearing on the face",US,2020-08-28
3,So-So,"Ok, so long as you don't wear glasses. No wire in nose bridge so regular or sun glasses fog up.",US,2020-10-30
3,Xl too big even with beard.,Its way too big. Read comment saying you need the xl for having a beard but its way too big on me still. They are nice masks but just way to big at xl for a normal face with beard.,US,2021-01-09

3,Not the best but better than most,Very soft and breathable. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is after wearing the covering for a few hours (as required for my job) the ear loops start to hurt the backs of my ears.,US,2021-01-28
3,Not worth for the money.,"The masks are made from very thin fabric, not worth for the prices. Design is ok. I got size M based on the chart, but it is still very small.",US,2020-10-08

3,Any mask should cotton,"Those mask are not maid from cotton, if it‚Äôs hot outside the face gets very hot under the mask, it‚Äôs not comfortable to use them in the hot weather",US,2020-07-11
3,Ear straps too long for 8 year old,Got these for my 8 year old. The ear straps are still to long and the mask falls off his face. Had to buy some adjusters to use with it. It's even a little big for my 14 year old,US,2020-07-20

3,It's okay.,"I would give 4 stars if not for the fact that fhe sizing chart is a bit off. I used a measuring tape for the bridge of my nose to my chin and it measured out to be about 5 and a half inches. The actual mask sits just below my chin making it slip off when yawning or coughing. As far as the effectiveness of the mask. The 3 layers aren't extremely tight woven which makes the mask absolutely wearable, however my concern is that it's not offering others around me as much protection as it could. I was able to blow a flame from a lighter out roughly 6 inches from my face. It is fairly comfortable beaides being a bit small. Would definitely order a size larger than the graph indicates.",US,2020-07-09
3,THINNEST CLOTH MASK I'VE ENCOUNTERED,"This mask feels too thin. While it's undoubtedly no thinner than the blue surgical masks we're all wearing these days, it does not provide confidence; those masks at least have a built-in filter.

PROS:
- lightweight
- really provides good coverage of your face
- no gaps on the cheeks
- better protection than a bandana

CONS:
- huge gaps at the top of the mask by the eyes
- minutes after removing the mask, I can still feel where the ear loops pulled on my ears
- the mask just feels too thin
- I have no confidence that this mask is capable of protecting me.

BOTTOM LINE: If I wear this mask out of my home it's going to be with a blue surgical mask on under it.",US,2020-06-14
3,Acceptable Though Not Superior Mask,"This is a lightweight and stretchable mask that may well serve for many purposes, such as visiting the grocery store. It is relatively comfortable and you can easily breathe through it, though it can slip off the nose when talking. It is hard to tell how much protection it offers against viruses, though probably about the same level of other simple cloth masks. I was a little disappointed in the lightness of the material, and have to wonder if it will be protective enough if exposed to the coronavirus. The descriptive material that comes with the masks says only that they ""block particles,"" with no specific standard noted.",US,2020-06-21
3,"These look nice, but they get very hot on the face","These masks are well constructed and fit nicely on the face, they have that curve around the nose to make them fall a little better around the nose. They don't feel too tight or pull my ears forward.

They're double lined which is nice but they're also made of a synthetic material which is NOT very breathable. I don't mean I can't breathe, I still can, my face just gets very hot and uncomfortable pretty quickly while wearing this. They're just not the nicest to wear. I've noticed cotton masks are a lot more comfortable to have on, especially on hot days.",US,2020-07-10
3,Caveat Emptor,"Generally, I think you get what you pay for, so don't expect too much from a mask that only costs $6.33. The fit and stretchiness are okay. I am an average-sized adult male so I bought Large, which is a bit loose. Maybe it'll shrink a little when I wash it. If you are looking for 100% cotton, keep looking. The packaging indicates that the outer shell is 100% Polyester DWR (Durable Water Repellent), the middle layer is 65% Polyester & 35% Cotton, and the inner layer is 65% Polyester & 35% Cotton with Agion Antimicrobial agent. Combined, the three layers of fabric are not very breathable. I have no significant difficulty inhaling through the mask, but when I exhale the mask traps a lot of the moisture, which then is forced out around the edges. Since there is no wire to form-fit the mask to your nose, a lot of the exhaust goes out the top, which fogs up my glasses. Disposable masks with the wire at the bridge of your nose are better at mitigating this effect. I can use these masks for short periods of time, like a trip to the grocery store, but I couldn't wear it for hours. It's too steamy.",US,2020-07-12
3,"Not great fit, a bit too thick for easy breathing","These are OK. The fit is a little weird even though I used the measurement guide on the product description. They are a bit bulky and not super fun to breathe thru, definitely would not want to wear these all day, but for a quick trip somewhere they work. The fabric is soft and the elastic is stretchy. Overall, I don't love the fit or feel of them, though.",US,2020-06-20
3,Prendre taille S pour enfant,"J‚Äôai suivi les. COnseilles et pris taille M pour mon fils de 8 ans c‚Äôest bcp trop grand
J‚Äôaurai du prendre du S comme j‚Äôavais pr√©vu
Le tissu est √©pais
Les lani√®res fines et laches ne semblent pas tr√®s solides et √©lastiques",France,2021-01-21
3,Comfortable but defintely cost more,Meh. For the money I think the AO saftety masks are a better tighter fit and a better deal. Granted these are more comfortable because of the wider straps. If I had to wear for 8 hours or longer I might prefer these.,US,2020-06-22
3,No nose adjustment ring,I had to return this mask although I liked the quality and comfort. Unfortunately it does not have a nose ring thus it does not allow a reasonable fit over the nose. This flaw makes the mask likely to be much less effective in filtering the air.,US,2020-07-02
3,Odd sizing,"**UPDATE - 3 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS WONDERFUL IN FIXING ISSUES....
Nice fabric. I was expecting it to be too thin but its enough for me to be comfortable with my children wearing. I bought the small/kids size for my 5 year old and 8 year old. It fits my 8 year old odd, the material in not wide enough to keep her nose covered when she talks and the bands are too loose around her ears. My 5 year old has a small face and her nose bridge is pretty flat and they don't fit at all, too big on her. I wish there was a metal wire to bend around the nose area for a better seal. There really needs to be a wire for the nose bridge with the such odd fit for both kids. The company uses a chemical on the masks that they dont disclose of untill you open the package and read everything. Very frustrating. Many people probably don't even notice. I will post pics of the ingredients that came on paper with the masks. The masks are next to a small female hand. These run very odd in size for kids.",US,2020-07-07
3,Made in USA???,"I asked for ""Made in USA"" choices. I thought that is what I was buying. This was made in Viet Nam. That's ok, but why doesn't Amazon show me the choices that I ask for?",US,2020-06-26
3,"Medium is best for an adult... overall ok, but not ideal.","I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and bought size Medium for myself, my 13 yo daughter, and my boyfriend. Not sure why they‚Äôd call
Then youth masks because they‚Äôre certainly large enough for the average sized adult. A large would‚Äôve been too big. The ear straps will probably take some getting used to as they were comfortable for about 2-3 hours then started to really hurt. We bought them for the gym and while breathable they really get like a soggy cloth sitting on my face so these are probably not for exercise.",US,2020-09-24
3,"Soft and comfortable, but keeps glasses well and truly fogged and moves around.","If it hugged tighter around the nose, this would be decent. It's super soft, the seam is made so there's a decent gap between the mask and my mouth, and doesn't pull on the ears... But as it is, the gap along the sides of my nose means practically all the air movement is through that gap and straight up my glasses. Keeps them quite throughly fogged up even with a fresh coating of anti-fog on them.

And it hooks a bit too well under the chin. One good yawn will pull it completely off my nose. I'm touching my face entirely too much while out and about, constantly rearranging the thing or holding it around my nose so I can see.",US,2020-08-01
3,Size Small for Blue too big,"We love these masks, my son is very picky so it was great that he left the white one on longer. When I saw the blue one on sale I thought it looked so cute with the color, but it's so much bigger than the size small White one. I switched him from virtual to traditional because our covid cases in our area are so much lower now, so he went back to Kindergarten which is good for him. After I washed it, we don't try things on without washing them first, that's when I realized it was too big and wouldn't fit over his nose. It just hangs down under his nose which defeats the purpose. So maybe if they make the blue ones similiar to the small white ones we would consider buying them again. Til then I guess if I need to I'll just get the small size white ones and hopefully they didn't change the size of those either.",US,2020-10-22
3,Meh.,"I purchased this particular mask (or set of three, rather) after a lengthy but unscientific search. My primary diligence consisted of being led by search engine suggestions to results as to what is ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù and ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù, and making my selections based on the reviews offered.

Being that those were my main search criteria, I feel justified in my disappointment that these masks are neither.

I had purchased these for domestic travel, and ended up swapping them out for the disposable variety.

Why am I giving them three stars? Spirit of generosity, aside; I gave them 5 stars for ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù, which grosses up the average rating to 3 stars. Yes, these masks are soft. But then again, so are socks.",US,2021-02-01
3,I would not recommend,"Pros: These masks are soft, lightweight and comfortable plus they look nice

Cons: they are thick and wearing them made me sweat so much and felt suffocating. Definitely not for using for long periods of time.

I have been looking for something I can wear for 8 hrs + for work....I loved the way these look and feel but once on, it felt like I had a sleeping bag on my face and I sweat so much and felt overheated. Guess I have to keep looking.",US,2020-09-20
3,Nicely constructed face mask,"This face mask is from Viet Nam and is well constructed and finished (unlike so many other masks from all over that are sloppy and poorly sewn). The Amazon webpage says it has a triple layer of fabric, which I can‚Äôt confirm, but will take their word for it. The fabric is fairly easy to breath through, is very soft, and dries fairly quickly after washing. One item is missing, though ‚Äî there is no metal nose wire for adjustment, so there is some exhaled leakage up into the eye area, which is not good, especially if you wear eyeglasses. If they would add a nose wire, I would give this mask a five star rating. Order fulfilment and shipment was very quick.",US,2020-09-06
3,Good for a walk/shopping..,"So the good news is this mask is great for guys like me with a big head(!) it provides full coverage over my nose and chin.. So A+ there.. HOWEVER, if you plan on working out with these you very well may struggle to breathe comfortably as it really traps all of your breath and has zero ventilation. Unfortunately, I'm still on the hunt for the perfect mask for working out. I'll keep these for shopping runs / walks etc..",US,2020-06-30
3,You Really Have to Be Careful With Size,"I ordered ""Large"" based on other personal reviews/anecdotes and now I'm returning my purchase for a refund.

Absolutely would not cover my nose without immediately falling. I had to double loop each side and basically cut off the circulation to my ears, to make it work. If it would've fit my face, I think I'd be a much bigger advocate.

I'm not really sure which measurements are helpful... but I'm 5'10 and 170 lbs. I know that doesn't really help with facial structure or measurement but... LARGE didn't work for me.",US,2020-09-01
3,"Good Size for Large Face, but not Fitted","I have a larger face and head, so most of the masks are a bit small for me. I bought this mask because it had an XL size available. The size was adequate, but it is not very well fitted since there is no nose wire reinforcement to help mold the mask to your face. The material is also very light weight and porous, so I don't think it probably isn't very effective. One plus about the material is that it does not shrink or wrinkle in the wash. Overall, it is comfortable to wear and of a decent size, but falls a bit short of my expectations.",US,2020-10-29
3,No Size Fits,"I've ordered these three times in three different sizes. I ordered the larges initially, as other masks I've tried tended to be small. The larges were quite a bit too big. Then, I ordered the mediums. There was barely any difference between the large and medium, the mediums were still slightly too big. Because of how similar the large and medium were, I figured I'd try the smalls, despite the child size listing. The pictures show the difference between the mediums and smalls. The smalls are tiny. Still don't fit. These seem like they'd be nice, but none of the sizes fit me.",US,2020-11-20
3,Quality is NOT consistent!,"After having initially been impressed, we ordered this exact same item from the same seller multiple times over the course of a few months. The first few sets of masks were great! But over time, the quality of the elastic used got cheaper! The actual size of the mask also got smaller in the newer sets we received! I can no longer recommend this item ** Update** Seller kindly sent me a replacement item, so they get 5 stars for customer service and trying to make things right. The Replacement item had same inconsistencies, but I appreciated their efforts!",US,2020-09-13
3,"Good product, but check the size","I ordered these masks because I have to fly during the pandemic. I had ordered the smallest size available on Amazon, but what I got was Extra Large. I did not have time to exchange these masks before I had to fly. Luckily, these masks are easily altered to fit with needle and thread, which is what I did. When they fit, these masks are soft, breathable, and efficient. You can test them by putting one on and blowing as hard as you can with your hand held in front of your face. I could feel the breath on my hand only when it was very close to my face.",US,2020-11-18
3,"Poor quality, inconsistent fit.","The product came sealed in a plastic package that had to be cut open which I like because it‚Äôs clean. Right out of the package one of the masks was ripping away from the seam. Each mask had different size ear loops which made for an inconsistent fit and resulting in the mask being loose and falling off my face. Other than that, the masks do seem soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, because of the poor quality and they don‚Äôt consistently fit I will be returning them.",US,2020-10-09
3,"Comfortable, thin","Nice masks but I ordered too big. Thought I needed extra large because it seems like most facemasks are too small for me, but XL was too big. I bought another set in L size and they‚Äôre perfect.

The fabric is quite thin. I can breathe very easily, which makes me wonder how effective this particular fabric is.

Quality seems durable; well-constructed. Went through the washer and dryer just fine.

Very soft on my face.",US,2020-12-14
3,"big! soft! hard to breathe, hot","I've been wearing paper masks, they work fine but are too narrow for my face. So I bought these. They are BIG! that's nice. They are made of some man made plastic-ish material that does not breathe. It holds in heat/sweat so in the winter that's nice I guess... but these things are 10x harder to breathe through than paper masks. I have one in my pocket for quick trips, but extended wear? I'd die! I would not buy it again for the reasons stated, but that's my personal opinions and usage.",US,2021-02-03
3,The Blue in Size Small Kids is actually a Medium Adult,"The mask are very comfortable and one of the only one's that my girls will wear for long periods of time. We have been testing them out so see which one would work best for when school starts back up. These hit the mark, only issue is when I went to order more and added the Blue Small size, they came in and it was definitely alot bigger than the White ones. It was actually the same size as mine that I ordered in Black Medium. Vendor needs to update sizing or ship correct sizes when ordered.",US,2020-07-07
3,"It's true your glasses do not steam up as much however, .......","It's true your glasses do not steam up as much and the ear loops are soft and stretchy so your ears are much happier that most of the masks I've seen. However, I do wonder if the porous nature of the fabric is a good thing. One of the comment I've seem re the home made cotton mask is how porous the are. Not a good thing for protecting outgoing or incoming. In reading reviews one person that claimed he could blow a candle out with his mask on. I didn't try it but I can well believe it.",US,2020-08-07
3,Soft masks,"These are nice and soft. The ability to order sizes means that ear comfort/coverage can be matched to face size so that is mighty nice - I got large which fit just right on my fat head without excessive tugging at the ears. The reason I'm only giving three stars is that they are the warmest mask I've tried thus far and that is saying something. I wouldn't want to wear one for a long time. However, as a backup that's easy to keep in the pocket, they are nice.",US,2020-09-06
3,"Just a little too big, and no nose strip.","I got these because large size masks can't handle the power of my Jay Leno chin. Unfortunately, they're just a little too big for my head. The loops hang loose on my ears, leaving coverage gaps at the cheeks and chin. The real killer is the nose area. Since the masks have no metal former at the nose, it also leaves plenty of room for air to pass there as well. I can't fault the comfort of the fabric, but without that metal former, I can't recommend these masks even for people with more prodigious noggins than my own. Wearing a mask without a nose strip is tantamount to not wearing a mask at all, y'all!",US,2020-09-16
3,Size Small Too Large For My Kids,"I orderd a package of the small for my children, 8 year old boy who is on the smaller side and a 5 year old girl who is above average for her age. The masks fit neither. Just sitting still they would fall down and expose their nose and mouth completely and they were too large for their faces. They fit my wife just fine (5'3"" 120). The label on the package states size small but possibly that is not what was placed in the package.",US,2020-08-16
3,Nice fabric. Sore ears.,"I purchased these masks because they come in a variety of sizes. After referring to the sizing chart, I clearly fell into the middle of the size large masks. The primary issue I have is not the size of the mask on the face, but the stretch on the earloops. There isn't enough. The back of my ears are sore after just a short time with these masks on. I think the manufacturer should consider adjustable ear loops or ties. Otherwise, the fabric is nice and comfortable, and they hold up well to washing. Mixed feelings.",US,2020-08-30
3,Bought a Medium.. shrunk after wash..,"Get one size up. After wash mine is unusable as it is too small for my face now.
Also, the lack of a nose wire fogs my specs. Definitely not recommended for those who wear glasses.
The only good thing about this is the softness of the material and the right length from ear to ear. Does not pull the ear after wearing for a few minutes.",US,2020-12-05
3,"Soft, too thick, hot no thin metal piece for proper nose fit",Nice color and ear lobe elastic But these are hot a little heavy and fit it a little loose because there is no sewn in thin metal piece that conforms to your nose. Had high hopes for these but will keep them as spares.,US,2020-08-21
3,Measure your face.,I figured a large would fit since the adults were ordering the large. Well they're way too loose on my face. Kind of disappointed. Don't want to return them since they would probably end up in the garbage. Should've ordered a medium. Definitely run a little big.,US,2020-07-27
3,Size matters,"This mask does not have adjustable ear loops and for the large adult size the mask was too loose. The company offered to refund my purchase but I told them I could tie knots on the loops and make them work. But had I read about the loops being large, I wouldn't have purchased them. I suggested they make adjustable loops. The mask is soft and comfortable. Just a pain to get it to fit.",US,2020-11-15
3,Nice but one of them was defective,"These are very nice masks. I bought 3 in a pack one but unfortunately one of them came ripped. üòï

I ordered small for my kids based on the review. But I should have bought medium. If you have kids 12+, order medium. Small fits my 9 year old good.",US,2021-01-17
3,not impresssed,"These are VERY small, and have a VERY pronounced nose bump out. They fit, as I have a very small face. But they would not fit most adults. There is no nose piece in them, but they seem to stay in place okay without it. They just seem quite thin and flimsy. Not sure I trust them to provide decent protection even for simple store runs.",US,2020-09-22
3,Gets hot,"The mask is well made and breathability is initially very good. I also like the thin ear straps because I wear both eye glasses and behind the ear hearing aids, so there is very little real estate behind my ears, but after a short while, especially in stores shopping or just indoors, it gets uncomfortably hot.",US,2021-01-03
3,Good mask but they run big,Seems to be a good quality mask but it runs way too big for my 3 & 5 year old kids. It‚Äôs hanging off both their faces - they only somewhat fit if I twist an extra loop on their ears. Probably better for older kids.,US,2020-08-01
3,These run small,These run small. I‚Äôm adult and ordered medium. I think most adults would need a large or XL because the small is better for youth and fits so tight there‚Äôs very little room to breathe and makes mask hot. Measure carefully and err on the next size up. They do use a comfy material. I‚Äôm giving mine away. Too tight.,US,2020-09-09
3,Too small,"The masks are smaller than we expected. We are average adults, did the measurement before ordering according to the chart in product description, but we found ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù probably fits a child better.
The material is soft and comfortable, but thin, not sure how much protection it would provide.
We washed the masks already before trying on, so we won‚Äôt return them.",US,2020-06-30
3,"Soft and comfortable, but too thin for COVID IMO","I have reusable/washable masks from three other providers and one local sewing shop. All four vary in breathability, thickness and comfort. But the material for all four is heavier and thicker than these EnerPlex masks - and 3/4 have the metal strip to conform to the bridge of your nose. These are soft and very comfortable - but no thicker than most of my tee shirts. Given the ""three ply"" description I expected something more alike all my other masks.",US,2021-01-15
3,Care of Product,"The reason for the mediocre review was the fact that the masks had to be dried flat after washing to ""avoid shrinkage"". It took two days to dry indoors even in California 87 degree weather. Prior to ordering the masks this fact was not revealed. Otherwise, the masks fit well, are super soft and arrived in a timely manner. If I had known the drying method I would have ordered more quantity to accommodate washing and drying time rotation.",US,2020-10-16
3,Good material and size but no nose wire,"The material looks good quality and the size and shape are great but... there's no nose wire. IMO a big flaw because it moves up an down. I wear glasses and the lack of nose wire causes not the seal properly around the nose, thus causing a lot of fogging on my glasses.",US,2020-10-24
3,These masks are great but NOT for someone with a very large head or wide face,"Bought these masks for someone with a large head and very wide face and they still do not fit. The masks are well made, quality material but not large enough for use for the intended person. Advertised for someone with a beard but not sure if they would work for that either.",US,2020-08-13
3,Good fit,"I am a small person and find most adult masks to be loose, so I ordered these hoping for a better fit, which I did get. However, the mask seems very thick to me and not easy to breathe through. Also, my eyeglasses tend to fog up more than with other masks.",US,2020-10-10
3,Decent masks,"Decent product. Pretty soft and comfortable. Also holds up well in the laundry. There is nothing at the top of the mask to secure it on the top of your nose, though; so I do have to pull it up quite a bit. I would suggest the maker add some sort of metal strip to help keep it secure.",US,2020-09-26
3,"These are too big for me, but my husband can use them.","These (youth size) are too big for me, 5'2'' 120 pound woman. My 6 ft tall 170 pound husband can use them, though.
The size I ordered was as according to the size chart.
But if they did fit me, they are too thick and I can't breath any how.",US,2020-07-02
3,Not as Thick as I‚Äôd Like,"I bought these based on other‚Äôs reviews. I did not like them as well as some others did. They are very thin and easy to blow through, which is a deal breaker for me. I gave them 3 stars because I will still use them by double masking.",US,2020-08-29
3,Not very cooling,"I was really looking for a mask that would be cooling. I generally get really hot under masks so I was excited to find this one for the price! Unfortunately, it's not very cooling at all, and the material doesn't really have any wicking effects besides that of normal cotton.",US,2020-09-21
3,Makes my beard itchy,I don‚Äôt know if it happens to anyone else but these makes my beard itchy. First time a mask is itchy to me. I also wanted black masks but they were out of stock. I‚Äôll just keep them but will not buy more of these.,US,2020-12-15
3,Not child sized,"I purchased these with the understanding that they would be for a child but these seem more suitable for an adolescent than a six-year-old. Quality masks, easy to put on but the sizing is just a bit off for my needs.",US,2020-10-21
3,Absolutely not breathable cotton,I love the mask...it fits perfectly but I just cannot breath in it. This is not breathable fabric at all,US,2020-09-08
3,Okay at best.,These are only okay at best. Somewhat uncomfortable straps that cut into my ears. Expensive too for what you get. I don‚Äôt expect that they will last. Hot also. There are certainly better alternative.,US,2020-08-07
3,Ear loop detached before first use.,"The fabric is very soft and comfortable. My only problem with these masks was one of the ear loops detached during my first washing, before I could even use it. That means poor quality control on the stitching.",US,2020-09-05
3,"Thin, not cotton lined. Does the job, not a great fit.","After the first wash and air dry, the elastic is loose causing mask slippage, and too much hands on time. Not what you want in Covid. Not a fan of the center seam masks after trying these, they project too far off my face. Bought a medium, I'm a petite person..maybe I would fit the kids small?",US,2020-11-01
3,Does not appear to have the waterproof layer,"The outer layer is reported to be waterproof or water resistant, but I drop water on it and is absorbed completely. The research from various sources recommend a water resistant layer. Disjointed.",US,2020-07-14
3,these should include metal strip to conform to the face,"masks are ok, but they need a metal strip to conform to the face.

3,"Good mask, terrible size guide","This is a good mask, but the size guideline is terrible. I measured my face like they recommended, and got a mask so small i'm shipping it to my 2-year-old niece.",US,2020-11-08
3,Way too big,These are super nice comfortable and breathable. My only negative is that it's huge for my 7 yo son. It fits me as an adult. Size small not sure. Wish they had an xsmall size,US,2020-08-25
3,Masks would be great if they weren't so small,"Nice fabric and decent design, but the masks are too small. I'd be adjusting it all day, which defeats the purpose. I'd go with something else, unless you have a small face.",US,2020-09-23
3,Hot,"Nice, soft fabric as advertised. Wish they added the mask is hot, a little scratchy. PS extra large isn‚Äôt extra. The esr rings are a little tight.",US,2020-11-05
3,Wouldn‚Äôt Recommend for Glasses Wearers,"They are comfortable, very breathable, and soft, but they need a nose wire. Too much air escapes out the top, which causes terrible fogging if you wear glasses like I do.",US,2020-11-04
3,An OK mask,Mask is soft and comfortable but it falls off my nose when I talk. I guess you could say it‚Äôs too small for my face even though it‚Äôs L/XL. This mask might be more appropriate for women and children.,US,2020-07-30
3,Disappointed!,"Disappointed! The size measurement for proper fit is incorrect‚Äîthe large is much larger than stated. Also, the fabric is very thin. Are these masks really three-ply thick?",US,2020-08-24

3,Soft and breathable but no nose clips so they fall down all the time,I returned these because these would constantly fall under my nose so I was pulling them all the time. Too bad because they were soft and breathable.,US,2020-08-08
3,Masks are thin,"I agree with one of the reviews that said the masks are very thin. It is hard to believe that they're 3-ply. They are comfortable though, and it's easy to breathe with them on. I'm undecided about whether I'll purchase more.",US,2020-10-21

3,The most comfortable masks I have put on but I can't wear them because they're an eyeglass fogger.,"There are some great points about this mask and then one that I don't love. I originally wanted masks with filters but thought I'd give these a shot because I like the shape of them. Honestly, I have purchased a few different masks It's always looking for that great fit and even without the metal piece in the top this fits very well. It is super comfortable, the most comfortable one I've tried yet. I like that it has the three layers of protection and an antimicrobial layer. I do wish it had an extra filter pocket but this seems to be fine. All of those points hit exactly where I wanted but, they're always has to be a rub.

I can't wear these because of fog my glasses up terribly. I guess it really does take that metal nose piece to redirect your breath in order to not fog up your glasses. I do hate that because again, these are so incredibly comfortable and fit so well for my average size face. If I can figure out a workaround to get these to work I will totally wear them. This will be perfect for someone who doesn't have that problem.",US,2020-06-08
3,Good for Small Faces,"These masks are not bad. Fairly well-made and comfortable to wear (if you have a small face). These fit my wife, but aren‚Äôt very comfortable for me.

3,Runs small!,"I bought the adult small but it fits my 5 1/2 year old and 3 year old better.
These masks are soft and comfortable but when I wear them and talk they pull down and uncover my nose.
My daughter is 5 1/2 years old and with some minor adjusting of the elastic, these masks fit her perfectly!
These masks wash up great with no wear.
I would suggest ordering a size up.
I‚Äôve found that the center seam in masks isn‚Äôt the most comfortable but the materials used in these masks is very comfortable.

3,"Large, comfortable, breathable","These masks are large enough to fit big faces. The fabric is soft and these masks are double layered. The only downside is the lack of a filter pocket on the inside. These are easy to wash though, so I guess you can get by without filters if you just wash them each day.

2,Not what I expected,I like the fact that the mask is a comfortable feeling material but exactly like a T-shirt so you‚Äôre wearing a mask size T-shirt on your face and it said something in the description about it being a two layer mask I don‚Äôt know where the other layer is and it doesn‚Äôt have any place to put a filter they‚Äôre really flimsy but like I said softer. It have a very very strong chemical smell I‚Äôve got them in the washer right now and I‚Äôm going to let them air dry so that they don‚Äôt shrink and then maybe I‚Äôll know more but not really happy with the quality. Unbeknownst to me my husband had grabbed one when I opened the package and took it with him and Ward in the store and he has asthma and he got light headed and then ended up having a asthma attack because of it. So I see they‚Äôre OK if you wanna just be sure and wash it and then just wear it so that you‚Äôre following rules but other than that I really wouldn‚Äôt recommend it,US,2020-07-01
2,"Earbands are solid fabric, not adjustable","Product is too small for some and too large for others in my family. Not adjustable.

It does not fit anyone safely (covering nose and mouth without gaps) and comfortably, which I expected. What I did not realize is the earbands are solid fabric, not elastic. They are thick (hot) and cannot really be tied to tighten them. This might work for you if you have a mask adjuster that you wear at the back of your head. Thick material (hot) but only one layer. At the price, maybe it will work for you. But you get what you pay for. For me, this ended up being a waste of money, where I could have bought maybe 1/4 the quantity for the same price, but they'd be useable and comfortable.",US,2020-07-05
2,ear bands are too short,"The mask itself covers from over my nose to under my chin but the straps for the ears are too short. They are not flexible like elastic ones on disposable masks so what happens is they pull instead of stretching. As a result, my ears flare out! And overall this is too tight for my average male adult face. I tried three on in case this was a freak of one of them but they all fit as poorly. No point returning these since I tried on three masks; I'll wash those and donate the others to someone who can wear them. Disappointed the description does not tell you the length of the straps.",US,2020-06-28
2,Pretty useless as is.,"If you use these as is, they are very loose on the face, and there‚Äôs hardly any elastic at all in the band, so unless your head is the perfect size you are out of luck. I was going to return these but ended up discovering that they fit me pretty well if I take the two earloops and pull them all the way back behind my head and velcro them together. I was lucky I had some extra 2 sided velcro laying around. Then I take some cut up tshirt and stuff them around the nose to get a better seal.",US,2020-09-05
2,Bought the same listing twice from same seller - received different styles,"The first batch of these that I ordered were just what we were looking for. Comfortable for everyone in the family with gathering at the nose to keep them in place. We liked them so much I ordered another batch. Since I expected them to be the same, I put them straight into the washer. We were very disappointed to find that the ear loops are much shorter and there is no gathering at the nose. I think they would only fit small children. Waste of money and now I'm on the hunt for more masks like the first order.",US,2020-11-19
2,Unfortunately too small.,"Apparently I have a huge head, which is news to me, as these masks barely make it around my ears and pull them forward quite a bit. Very uncomfortable. I would imagine they would shrink a little too upon washing, which would make them even worse. The material seems nice enough, just regular T-shirt material. Can't return them, so I guess I find someone that has a smaller head to give them to.",US,2021-01-06
2,The adult size is HUGE,Look my husband and son have very large round faces and they are way too big for both of them. I am hoping after I wash they will shrink a little. I strongly suggest child size if ordering for a woman. They fall off my face. I had high hopes for these masks. Maybe they changed the sizing or cut from previous reviews. I am disappointed.,US,2020-12-02
2,runs small,"Brought this to make as gifts. After reading reviews I still took the chance bc it was mix reviews. After washing and drying in machine, it shank tremendously. Now it fits my kids. I'm a small woman and it was tight on my face. I do like that there is a notch over nose so the kids can have a little breathing room.",US,2020-09-14
2,Meh. They are ok,"Very thin material. If you speak while wearing this and take a breath through your mouth, you‚Äôll ‚Äúinhale‚Äù it. I would have preferred something with a bit more stiffness. Also, it‚Äôs difficult to tell in from out and top from bottom as it is only one color material all the way through.",US,2021-01-26
2,Don‚Äôt buy!,"If these fit properly, it would have been great! They‚Äôre soft and feel comfortble but the small is probably made for a 2-6 year old and the large seems like it‚Äôs for an adult male‚Äôs face size. There‚Äôs no medium size. I would not recommend unless you fit one of those groups.",US,2021-01-15
2,Do not fit well at all,"Soft cotton but fit poorly. Very large and the straps have no elasticity. As such they do not fit well and even on an adult face fall right off with any movement. Really akin to a cotton underwear with a strap sewed on. Did not fit anybody in my family (6ft tall male, 5 ft tall woman, a teenager, nor an 11 year old). As such returning them.",US,2020-09-11
2,Too Easy to Inhale the Fabric!,These coverings fit reasonably well-but they fabric enters and leaves my nostrils with every breath which makes them unwearable. It's a little too soft a fabric to be using for such a purpose. I've returned them.,US,2020-09-18
2,Fits small,"Slightly too small. Adult male, not a huge head, and these are too small after wash. They shrank quite a bit. The fabric is maybe too soft. It will get caught in your mouth with every breath. Unfortunately cannot refund so big head people do not buy",US,2020-12-22
2,Gaping at the bottom,"I was excited to try these, as a lot of people said they fit well in the comments. I like the soft material. However, for me, my husband and my mom, they were gaping at the bottom. I don't think we have exceptionally small faces by any means, but the bottom hung down loosely past our chins. I will be giving them to a friend with a broader face - hoping they work out better for him.",US,2021-01-19
2,Does anyone make these mask that aren't trying to rip your ears off,Too small. Just like most mask I find. I'll give them to charity around the area. Does nothing for me. Wasted purchase.,US,2021-01-19
2,Way too big,"I thought these would fit myself and my two teens, but I was mistaken. These things are HUGE and since they aren't adjustable they're worthless to us. If you and/or your partner have a beard these may work.",US,2021-02-03
2,Runs really small,This product was advertised as adult size. It's just big enough for my average sized 11 year old boy (fits him snug and perfect). Or someone with a small head. My son says that it's comfortable and soft.... But boy is it small.,US,2020-11-30
2,Not a fan.,Masks are loose fitting and the ear loops had To be tied to fit. Once washed... forget it. They are not wearable once they are washed. They shrink and loose shape. Disappointed. But for the price it works as a one time wear.,US,2020-07-14
2,Just ok,It‚Äôs ok but it‚Äôs a little on the big side and when I washed it it didn‚Äôt shrink back down so now it‚Äôs even bigger..,US,2020-10-02
2,Too small,These are very small especially after washing/drying. Good value for small children.,US,2020-10-18
2,Not a big fan,The war loops were small and tight. The mask itself was a good size and covered your whole mouth but then the straps were so small that it made the fit weird. It‚Äôs a no for me.,US,2020-10-20
2,Cheaply made,"I was specting at least 2 layers. Black mask and white fabric inside like the ones I previously purchased. But that was not the case. It just a cheap ,thin piece of fabric",US,2020-12-13
2,Too loose,"Maybe these would fit someone with a gigantic head. The ear loops aren‚Äôt elastic, so it‚Äôs a loose fit - not snug at all, like it‚Äôs supposed to be.",US,2020-12-04
2,I would not recommend this product for medium to smaller faces.,There is either no elastic or very poor quality of elastic. Doesn't fit my face and it keeps dropping down from my nose which defeats the purpose of wearing a mask.,US,2020-07-22
2,Wearing it's hard to breath !!!!,"Has to breath wearing shopping , softness was good !!!!",US,2020-09-21
2,Mask,Well made mask but very big. Can not use will try and shrink in the dryer.,US,2021-01-06
2,Sloppy fit,"These slip off the face and won‚Äôt stay put. Bargain is too good to be true. Wanted a big stack of masks for a good price. Got it, but what good is it when everyone in my house refuses to wear these sloppy fit masks?",US,2020-12-29
2,You get quantity instead of quality,Only single ply and it doesn‚Äôt stretch very far little and comfortable on the ears for a big person,US,2020-09-29
2,Soft but too big,"These masks were soft, but way too big for my head (adult female). They were somewhat big on my husband too. They do not have ear adjusters.",US,2020-09-10
2,Too small for men,"Not much elastic in the loop; unwashed, the mask fits very tightly and material slips in mouth. Not good for individuals with a large head.",US,2020-09-01
2,Not as described,This is a duplicate purchase and it was not the same product as the first order. Very very disappointed. To small and seams very noticeable.,US,2020-10-23
2,Enormous,"These masks are gigantic. I don't know who would fit in these masks. I am a 6'3"" dude and these were far too large to be effective.",US,2020-12-15
2,Massive,"These were MASSIVE. Like, hung down around my lips and chin like a beard massive. Washing and drying didn‚Äôt help. It was wearable on my fianc√© but still very loose. Unless you have a pretty big head I‚Äôd say these won‚Äôt work for you",US,2020-09-28
2,Meh,"While these masks are soft, the lack of metal nose shaper made it slide off my face. After wearing for 2 hours my son says it was wet from his breathing.",US,2020-09-23
2,It won‚Äôt fit my tiny face,The mask is soft but it runs so small. I understand it not fitting my husbands face but I have small ears and face Don‚Äôt waste your money. It might fit children.,US,2020-10-05
2,Stretch out too much,They stretch out of shape after a few minutes the fit too loosely.,US,2020-09-23
2,Great product,Their not to thick or thin,US,2020-12-31
2,"Way to long .. not wide, but long",It fits right around your nose but hangs 3 inches past you chin..,US,2020-09-16
2,Too thick,"The cotton is too thick, we cannot breathe out of them",US,2020-07-01
2,fits small,Fits small and pulls on ears. The front bunches up.,US,2020-06-29
2,Face mask,"I thought I was getting a 3 pack, it that‚Äôs ok. They‚Äôre ok, but should have sent them back",US,2021-01-14
2,Bad cuts,Love them but some wrong made wrong and shape odd!,US,2020-10-23
2,To big,It‚Äôs nice but too big for me,US,2020-07-27
2,beware,These are good mask but more than half of them came apart and I had to sew the ear loops back on,US,2020-07-05
2,Value for money? Not sure,"After using the mask a few time, the mask stretches and becomes too loose.",US,2020-11-11
2,Too big,Too large,US,2020-10-14
2,bad fit,"bands do not stretch enough, to tight on the ears.",US,2020-09-24
2,Breathable but loose,They had no adjustment ear pieces so they were a little too loose.,US,2020-09-05
2,Too big,Too big for my face,US,2020-09-15
2,Review,Way too big and no structure,US,2021-01-16
2,Good but little small,Running small,US,2020-09-15
2,Too big,To big for me perfect for a man's face,US,2020-09-10
2,Too large,They are thin and the ear straps are too large,US,2020-11-22
4,Size is too small for adults. Good for teens and kids.,These are not bad quality not the size is terrible for an adult. Your ears will be bent forward from the ear strings. Too snug and tight for an adult. Can‚Äôt imagine the for after a proper wash. Looks like I‚Äôll be donating these to a local school.,Canada,2020-09-30
4,Long straps,"Quality matches price, straps too long -but if you tie a knot then itll fit.",Canada,2020-09-26
4,"Really nice masks, but a bit too large for everyone.",These are too large for me and my teen daughters but fit my husband and my adult sons.,Canada,2020-11-18
4,Great value for the price!,"Got these masks today, here's a quick take:
- fits well
- slightly loose for those smaller jaw line/face but you can fit it by tightening the ear loops
- good quality fabric, quite breathable
- Made in Nicaragua",US,2020-06-19
4,Nice for Price and amount,"Looking at them, I thought they were big just for men. They actually fir nice for women as well. I was afraid to sell them, but I‚Äôve gotten nice compliments. I wish I‚Äôd bought more. They are comfortable and a (little loose) around the ears. I used vinyl to decorated them 350/30. If you want it tighter around the nose you can always purchase the adhesive nose bridges from Amazon, they were like $6 for 100.",US,2020-06-28
4,Comfy but sizes in bag vary - UPDATE - watch vendor source,"I bought these Masks to apply iron on decals for my daughters‚Äô sports teams. I did read the reviews about how sizes varied and that the ear loops do not stretch. I did make a point to measure all of the masks. In a bag of 24, I found the following:
Measurement are nose-to-chin X nose to max of ear loop
Qty 2 5‚Äùx7‚Äù
Qty 9 5.5‚Äùx7.5‚Äù
Qty 9 6‚Äùx8‚Äù
Qty 4 6+‚Äùx8‚Äù
Since the earloops do not stretch, if the mask sizes fit you well, it won‚Äôt tag on your ears. On the other hand, if you can‚Äôt fit into one of the sizes listed above then it will be uncomfortable and tug your ears like Dumbo. There is a chin dart sewed into a mask to help the mask stay under your chin (Gildon website info).
I got what I paid for - inexpensive masks to apply heat-transfer vinyl, but I did have to measure them all to make sure kids got one that fit.

UPDATE:
I bought these again, but this time it came from the Fantastical Group. First time was from Amazon. Fantastical Group masks do NOT have the dart (seam) for the chin and they are overall smaller! Fantastical masks are NOT Gildan - same material, ear loops are a little more stretchy - but not the Gildan. Kind of bummed, as I paid $29 vs $22 and I did not get what I expected.",US,2020-09-23
4,Comfortable but lack any directions for use,"A lot of companies have rushed masks into production and these seem to reflect the rush. The material is comfortable and the masks easy to breath through, but there don't seem to be many layers to it either. The ear loops are fairly thick fabric straps that aren't all that elastic. My order came in a clear bag with no picture or instructions so I've had to guess what is the inside vs outside and top vs bottom in the design intent.",US,2020-08-13
4,shrinkage,"I ordered these after reading other reviews that said they run small. I wanted them as a tie dying project for my grandchildren. They did the trick for me, The kids had a great time tie dying and once they were washed and put in the dryer, the masks fit young kids perfectly. My daughter and I let ours air dry and they were fine but the men in our family were not so lucky, right from the start these masks were toooooooo small.",US,2020-09-24
4,"Great price, delivered on time","Can‚Äôt beat the price. I ordered these as where I live it‚Äôs up to the building if they require masks or not. Having this many, I can keep some in my bag or in my truck Incase I need them or anyone around me needs one.
As an adult male, these fit ok. I did wash them in cold water and air dried them but they still shrank significantly. I also have a medium beard, and while these do fit me even after washing, the masks are kind of small (My beard has some to do with that, I know.)
It will serve its purpose if I have to wear one. Not sure how comfortable (or effective) these are if you had to wear them, say in an airport for several hours since they are cotton. It feels like wearing a sock across your face. It‚Äôs kind of weird.",US,2020-06-29
4,I would recommend these masks to people who's employers require them to wear a mask as a precaution.,"The mask fits just a little too loose but the contoured edges keep it close to my face. It's comfortable and breathable. The masks are 2-ply but I can still blow out a match wearing them. I wear bike a PM2.5 filter inside or a blue shop towel to add extra protection. The first pack was ""lost"" in transit so I recieved the second order 2 days later but I'm satisfied with the product.",US,2020-06-26
4,Black instead of white,We ordered white but received black - said that white was not available which is okay - it just that we ordered a pack of black and a pack of white at the same time - we received the black pack June 28th & we received another pack of black today. They are as advertised (2 layer instead of 3) I was kind of wanting to see if the white was cooler than the black but I am happy that we were able to get the mask.,US,2020-07-03
4,"Good masks, may not fit everyone.",Since I have a smaller face I ordered the kids size because the measurements were exact to other masks I have. Kids size was way way too small. My 8 yr old could not fit them. Maybe 1 or 2 yr olds can. Returned and ordered the adult size. Its loose on my face but won't fall because the shape of the mask. Good quality and I like that it's cotton because medical masks and other materials have caused breakouts on my face.,US,2021-01-10
4,I feel like I'm wearing a g-string on my face,"These times are a drag. These masks are okay. I was looking for a large pack of cheapish reusable masks so I wouldn't have to keep washing the same one. These work well enough for my very limited time in public; although, they are a bit thick and get heavy after breathing. The straps are a bit too thick as well, as I'm pretty sure they're literally made out of underwear banding -- and slightly short -- they pull my ears forward, so an ear-saver is needed. The face coverage is just about right.",US,2020-07-22
4,They are soft and comfortable to wear,"Easier to breathe with these on than a medical mask. Soft, comfortable cotton but they fit snug so they do pull slightly on my ears. My only complaint is I ordered white masks and was shipped black masks, but given the price I paid and the current unavailability of these masks in any color, white or black, I am keeping them.",US,2020-07-04
4,Very nice mask. Fits very well and the mask and straps are study. Nice and warm in cold weather.,"Overall, this was a great deal. Very comfortable and fits well. It goes under the chin so it stays in place. The straps are sturdy and sewn well. They hold up well to washing.

My only complaint is that they have that industrial smell and we had to wash them before using them. Other than that, I would recommend them.",US,2020-12-12
4,Great for most people.,These are super soft & comfortable. They fit most people. They look really small but actually fit snug for a comfy fit. However if you are a big person it may not fit. My husband is 6‚Äô5‚Äù and it is too small for him. (The disposable paper masks look too small on him also). My son is 6‚Äô3‚Äù and a bigger guy and it fits him snug and is comfortable.,US,2020-09-14
4,Good masks,"These are fine for adults. Our kids who are 13 and 16 can‚Äôt use them. Even after washing them all they‚Äôre still too big. I purchased the kids size first and they were way too small. The youth masks would probably fit ages 7 or 8 and under.
Good masks just a bit too big for teenagers.",US,2021-02-01
4,Worth the money but they run a lil big for my face,"They're too big for my face, maybe I should have gotten the kids sizeüòÇüòÇüòÇbut comfortable they are. I put them suckers into the washing machine to get the chemical smell out, dried them on high so that they would shrink some, and whallaaah perfection üòÉüëçüëçüëçüëç",US,2021-01-28
4,Decent...,"I love that you got so many in one set. They are durable, washable, and convenient. HOWEVER, they are not as breathable as other masks, and can get damp with heavy breathing or trying to talk. I work in a cold environment, and they do the job, but I often have to use a new mask later in the day that is dry and easier to breathe thru.",US,2021-01-14
4,Great mask for the price,"This mask is very stretchy; the material worked well for my vinyl iron-on project. Because of the amount of stretch, I could not put my project in the middle of the mask, but it worked well on the sides. Overall I was happy with the result.",US,2020-09-29
4,Very good face masks,"Soft and breathable. I've got a big head and the ear loops need 10 seconds of light stretching before they fit without bending my ears forward.
Covers my beard nicely.
Again, I have a big head; and depending how long this coronavirus lingers, I would buy these again.",US,2020-09-20
4,Works for work for me.,Was hoping they would be a more seamless construction to alow for a less complicated placement but there is an up and an outside. Other than that the mask is ok. Now i can change my mask about 4 or 5 times a day without waste.,US,2020-09-27
4,Good value but..,Good quality for the price. There is no wire nose piece for a better fit. These run very large. I have a small face and are a loose fit. So I would not recommend these for children or women.,US,2020-12-11
4,Too Small For an Adult,"I really the looks of these masks, but they are too small for an adult. I didn't notice until I had them for a while that they were for adults and youths. I've tried to stretch them but it didn't work.",US,2021-01-15
4,Great value for the price!,"Good quality fabric, quite breathable.This review has been written before 3 months.

# Most of my reviews are based on more than 3 0r 6 months later. Very few reviews are written earlier.Sorry!",US,2020-12-06
4,Ya gotta be crazy...,"...to spend $5 for a mask when you can get this pack at 64c each. Sure you may want to make a fashion or political statement, but c'mon, man, what's the point? Just buy this package once and you'll have a fresh new mask for every week between now and getting your vaccination.",US,2020-12-04
4,They're pretty good,"They look tiny but fit well. They wash really well, too. The only problem is they're not thick enough and there's no metal clip to fit over the nose, so there's a gap on either side.",US,2020-07-28
4,Slightly large but works,Slightly large for smaller faces but it works. There isn‚Äôt a clear distinction between the top and bottom of the mask. Other than that it‚Äôs a good product.,US,2020-09-13
4,Made for small/medium faces,"Bought these for my husband and they were too small. They were even a little small for me, too. I had to cut off the ear loops and sew on adjustable ones. Great price, though, so they were still worth it.",US,2020-09-22
4,Tight,This product runs a little small I ordered adult and it‚Äôs very tight pulling on my ears I have a average head size so you might want to order xl,US,2021-01-18
4,ear loops not elastic,"the mask is great quality, but I was expecting a little more stretch in the ear loops, very tight fit for adult males . alot of complaints about hurting ears due to being tight",US,2021-01-22
4,Quality,Not as breathable as would like,US,2020-12-12
4,"Decent sewing, comfortable- runs slightly large","Decent sewing, ear loops are generously sized. I would note these are ‚Äúadult‚Äù size as they do not fit my teenage girls well but do fit myself, 34 yo man. Decent comfort and simple washing makes them worth the bulk buy.",US,2020-09-24
4,Good product,Price was great for the amount. With 4 kids in school I needed plenty of masks. They aren't all uniformly made. Some are bigger than others.,US,2020-10-28
4,Nice,Fits my face nice. Little big for my teenage daughter. Nice coverage and protection.,US,2020-08-06
4,I like,The price is great I see these mask fit my face up to my eye glasses when I wear them,US,2020-07-02
4,Very Soft,I did like the mask it is very soft but it does run a little large,US,2020-09-18
4,"Soft, durable and breathable","These are by far the most comfortable and softest masks I‚Äôve worn. The only negative is it says for youth as well but, they are to big for my 12yr. Hence the 4 star instead of the 5",US,2021-01-20
4,Decent Quality,"Fair price,24 masks. bought for family in Cuba.",US,2021-01-18
4,Project Perfect Pieces,"CONS: sizes vary in packaging; too thick to add adjustable pieces

PROS: timely shipment, color was exact, sturdy material, breathable fabric, perfect for projects",US,2020-09-09
4,Good masks,"Very comfortable to wear and they wash well. I just wish they had more stability so they didn't rest against the nose which makes breathing a challenge. I had to purchase silicone mask guards to wear under these masks, which is just fine with me. I will buy these masks again.",US,2020-12-11
4,Excellent price for Quaility,"PROS: soft, breathable, cost effective

CONS: shrinks in dryer",US,2020-07-20
4,Seems a little tight,Was a little bit tight,US,2020-12-04
4,Great masks for a cheap price,"They work well, when I got them they smelled like pickles, but washing and drying them fixed that. Alittle tight when first putting on but they stretch and relax after about 10 mins. Decently breathable and for someone with a beard they don't flip up into my mouth constantly when I talk",US,2020-09-25
4,Good product,Fits good but stretches out quickly.,US,2020-09-15
4,As Advertised,Ok for the money,US,2020-11-09
4,A little loose but not unmanageable,"I ordered this product to try screenprinting on masks. I haven't gotten to it yet, but the material seems like it will work. The fit is a little bit loose for me, but that might just be because I have a small face. Nevertheless, I have worn it for two days in public and it is fine. Nothing particularly outstanding.",US,2020-09-05
4,TODO BIEN,"Suave y comodo, un poco grande.",US,2020-07-30
4,It's reusable,It's comfortable and I like the fact that it's washable.,US,2020-09-27
4,Great quality,I like the price . I initially ought them but price went up I‚Äôm sure bc if supply/demand . But I‚Äôve purchased them 3 times now. One order the mask came in a different design then the other 2 but still great quality,US,2020-11-03
4,Good buy,Fit well,US,2020-09-12
4,"Nice quality, but large.",Bought these for a high school cheerleading squad and they had to knot the ear piece bc they were way to big.,US,2020-09-19
4,"Great value, run large","Price can't be beat. They are bigger than other masks I have purchased and they don't have adjustable nose piece. Washing and running through the dryer help with the sizing. But to have this many extras available and for what I paid, I'd recommend.",US,2020-09-07
4,This mask is made for a woman with a big face or a man's face.,"I didn't like that the mask was way too big for my face. This is the first adult mask that was too big for me. Although the mask is two layers, they are two thin layers. However, the masks do wash and dry quite well.",US,2020-09-18
4,I wouldn't purchase again.,Too loose around the face and ears,US,2020-08-30
4,Comfort,The masks are nice but fit really big so you would need a way to shorten the loops. They are comfortable.,US,2020-10-08

4,"Soft, breathable and sturdy material",Very good and soft mask the only thing is that after a while of wearing the back of ur ears tend to get a little sore but after stretching it becomes more comfortable.,US,2021-01-17
4,Not for an adult male,The masks run small in my opinion. Especially after being washed. Might fit better if there were more adjustment to the elastic. These are more for women or children.,US,2020-09-24
4,Worth the price,I was a little nervous ordering these after reading reviews about it be too big. So yes they do come kinda big but the trick is to wash them and let them air dry.,US,2020-09-26

2,Out of breath and that's trying to be positive.,"Tried the product and not impressed. I was continually sucking in the fabric when breathing. Tried the match thing they suggest, FAILED easily. Could wear it at a birthday party and blow out the candles. At least it feels nice on my face. Not worth the money at all. Could have made this in two minutes at home from old bamboo sheets. The ear things work well. Sorry guys tried to be positive but having a hard time for the price to be positive. I don't think I could wear this for 10 minutes without straining to breath let alone for the 8 hours I have to be wearing masks. If they would accept returns I would send back.",Canada,2020-07-28
2,Grandeur Pour enfants.,"Grandeur pour enfant, peut-√™tre qu‚Äôen Cor√©e c‚Äôest pour adulte mais ici, c‚Äôest petit.

Si je mets le masque, d√®s que je parle, il descend et me lib√®re le nez et si j‚Äôessaye de le garder sur le nez, il me remonte dans la bouche.

Pour le reste, il est bien fait.",Canada,2020-06-15
2,Fit was fine but breathing easy was not.,"While the fabric was a selling point for me (softness), I didn‚Äôt realize that the very thing I liked would make breathing more difficult.

Because the fabric was soft and not stiff, it actually moved with each breath so I found that the material was being drawn close to, or even into, my mouth on every inhale. Not a comfortable feeling at all.",Canada,2020-08-03
2,Skip this one,"Both of us found this mask very hot and flimsy so when you breath it almost sucks in diminishing air way.
It‚Äôs very soft and comfortable at first but the comfort level changes once you have it on for a few minutes. We have had to order something to replace it.",Canada,2020-07-09
2,Smaller than expected,Smaller than expected even if I took the big one. Barely fit. And my glasses can‚Äôt fit correctly and are always unbalanced cause of the nose part on that is too hard. I‚Äôm sorry but it is what it is. I don‚Äôt say it garbage. It‚Äôs just not the good product for me as my face doesn‚Äôt fit and the fact I wear glasses,Canada,2020-07-22
2,Not clear getting what you paid for,"though soft, it feels thin. tag on product doesn't indicate the material, label on ""baggy"" said it was bamboo. mask appears larger in image than it actually is. easy to breathe through, but air escapes upwards and fogs up glasses.",Canada,2020-08-08
2,Too Small,"Very comfortable, but too small for my face. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, 210 lbs. I would consider myself average when it comes to the size of my face. I have not washed it, so it will probably be even smaller after the wash!",Canada,2020-08-21
2,Pour adulte???,Le masque n'est pas bien large et j'ai du mal √† le place pour bien couvrir le nez et le menton. C'est bien dommage car le tissu est agr√©able au toucher.,Canada,2020-06-17
2,Cannot breathe,It fits fine but I cannot breathe whatsoever. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this.,Canada,2020-07-19
2,Okay but not worth the price,"Had it for 10 days, worn it maybe 2 or 3 times, and it‚Äôs already coming apart at the seams. Feels nice but not that well made and not worth the price in my opinion.",Canada,2020-07-13
2,Straps too short.,"Straps to short, wears uncomfortably and pulls your ears out and forward because of short straps. Product was discarded and replaced with another supplier.",Canada,2020-10-23
2,Not man sized,Too small for a grown man's face. Ordered 2 so now my wifes all set. Look elsewhere for a mask unless you have a little head.,Canada,2020-09-13
2,Junk,"Quality is poor, fit is poor, comfort is poor. Rather stay at home than go out in this.",Canada,2020-07-24
2,Can‚Äôt talk,"All was good until I tried to talk. Mask would ride down exposing my nose as soon as I tried to speak. Otherwise, fine ; a work in progress.",Canada,2021-01-09
2,Doesn't pass the lighter test,You can test a quality of reusable mask blowing a lighter as you wear it. This mask blows a flame out within seconds of blowing lightly. Don't buy unless you're planning on adding another layer of cotton / fabric to it! The mask is way too thin to be protective,Canada,2020-06-19
2,Annoying label,"Lovely material. Super breatheable and feels great on skin.

Really annoying that the put this label on the front of the mask. No way to remove it without leaving a bit of the label left.

Have to wear it inside out which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's one faulty mask and not the same for all.

But overall very comfy.",US,2020-12-04
2,Too thin,Thought it was 3 layers not pk of 3,US,2020-10-31
2,Muy peque√±o,"El producto est√° muy caro para lo que ofrece, el tama√±o es para cara peque√±a y la varilla nasal es un alambre muy delgado , por el precio se puede conseguir algo mejor",Mexico,2020-11-29
2,Nope. No. Too soft and flimsy.,"I really like the soft fabric (thats why I chose it) and the wire on the nose piece. I have a different cloth mask with a shiny inner material that sticks to my face, which bothers me, so I bought this one as a replacement. This mask seemed great because of the soft inner fabric, but it‚Äôs TOO soft and has no structure. I wore it on a walk today for the first time and it almost suffocated me! The fabric moves inward with every inhale and suctions to your nose and mouth. I hate it. Won‚Äôt use it a 2nd time. Sorry.",US,2020-05-22
2,"Doesn't help prevent airborne pathogen spreading, but comfortable.","The mask gets 2 stars because it is comfortable and soft, as well as easily adjustable. If you are looking for a mask for a costume, or to hide your identity or something, the mask works great for that.

However, I bought the mask to help prevent pathogen spread, and this mask fails the lighter test. I put a lighter a few inches in front of my face with the mask on and tried blowing, coughing and sneezing. The lighter blew out every time. This shows that the mask isn't blocking the airborne molecules from spreading out of my mouth. I've done the same test with medical disposable masks and they work every time. But I wanted to find a mask that I could wash and reuse. This mask isn't what I'm looking for. And if you're trying to find a mask that helps prevents the spread of airborne illness, it's not what you're looking for either.",US,2020-06-28
2,It‚Äôs...just okay. Not what I was hoping for.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I got this mask because I needed one quickly and most the other sites I was looking at didn‚Äôt have their masks available to ship immediately. I also wanted a mask with a flexible nose piece so it wouldn‚Äôt fog my glasses, and with adjustable ear loops. For all of those reasons this mask seemed to fit the bill, and I ordered despite the low amount of reviews (which is very unlike me on Amazon!).

But, honestly, this mask isn‚Äôt great. The material is thin and flimsy (I have no idea what the other reviewers saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúthick‚Äù are going on about‚Äîwhat was your last mask made out of, tissue paper?). The material moves in and out with my breath, uncomfortably conforming to my face as I breathe in as to very slightly suffocate me, and visibly inflating like a bubble when I breathe out.

It also doesn‚Äôt look that great. The seam at the chin is pretty weird and I think you‚Äôd need a specific face shape for it to line up not-weirdly.

Two stars for the nose wire and adjustable ear loops, though. Those work well. And the mask is soft‚Äîbut too soft. I wish the fabric were more substantial so it didn‚Äôt cling to my face with the slightest intake of breath. Unless this is the only mask in-stock and you really need one ASAP, I‚Äôd suggest you look elsewhere.",US,2020-05-30
2,Disappointingly and Cheap,"Bought three for the family unfortunately very disappointed. I did not stay down under my chin. Somewhat on the small size and very cheaply made. I would guess if you have a small face and weigh under 175 it might be okay. The ear strap is a cheap quality as well as the flexible nose bridge. As you breath it does not have any structure and therefore moves with every breath. For the money buy yourself some material and elastic and you can make a dozen masks for what one I paid $14 (each). Finally, even after rinsing it out before wearing, its still has a weird smell you continue to exhale. I know it‚Äôs not a N95, but I somewhat doubt it‚Äôs protection ability to counter mouth spray particles when exhaling. Would not buy again.",US,2020-07-05
2,"My husband loves this mask, but its not effective for protection","My husband loves the softness, the comfort and the ability to throw it in his pocket and go. However, I look at a mask as a means of protection and this mask was just a one layer cover that didn't keep out or keep in a viral load if sneezed or coughed into or onto. It does however, work as a cover to a surgical mask. You get the protection from the surgical mask and the ""non-medical look"" from the black mask. He bought me one too, but I don't use it because I work in a hospital and prefer the surgical masks. When we travel, we use the K95 masks and he uses this one to cover that mask.",US,2021-01-28
2,Don't recommend if you want effective mask,"I really like this mask because it's so soft and light weight BUT it's so thin that I question how effective it could be. It's double layered, but I wish it was made so I could slide in a filter. It's not cotton but bamboo. It fits perfectly and has adjustable ear straps as a plus but if you're looking for a mask that's for effectiveness, not just soft and fashionable, I wouldn't recommend this mask. It's just too thin and without a filter and being bamboo....Sure, it's definitely breathable but this mask is for people who are only wearing a mask to get into stores to appease people (for show) but don't really care if it's helping, effective.",US,2020-06-06
2,Less breathable than other masks,"This mask is very nicely made and wonderfully soft. However, with each breath, the soft fabric presses against the wearer's nostrils, and it is not easy to breathe through it. I wore this mask for a long day around people when purchasing an automobile, so I wore it for longer than I usually have to wear a mask. I was dismayed at how difficult it was to breathe, especially when walking or exercising. Even when sitting, it produced an uncomfortable and distracting sensation. For that reason, I would not recommend this mask. I have had much better success with simple cotton masks, which are less likely to move with each breath because they are slightly stiffer and less likely to enter the nostrils or mouth when inhaling.",US,2020-08-12
2,Everything fine except glasses fog up,"I have several masks that are good except they all fog up wearing sunglasses. A friend told me to buy one with a wire to shape around the nose,

I ordered this mask because is has a wired nose. Also the price is much higher than other masks.

I have been wearing this mask steadily since it arrived. No matter how I shape the nose piece it still FOGS UP!

I might as well keep wearing the cheap masks.

So if you are a genius and will be able to keep this mask from foggy up with glasses, BUY CHEAP MASKS and save money.",US,2020-09-14
2,"Too flimsy and thin, can't really breathe in it bc is suctions to the face","This is too flimsy and thin like it is made out of women's undergarment material. It fogged up my glasses and every time I took a breath, I would breathe in the mask and it would suction to my face, kinda like it was a plastic bag. I bought it for my first day at work at a new job and had to swap it out with another mask because I couldn't have a conversation wearing it. Since I already wore it, it's not really sanitary to return.",US,2020-08-19
2,Incredibly comfortable but shockingly hard to breathe in,"This is easily the most comfortable, soft, nicely-fitting facemask I've tried. At the same time, it was like trying to breathe through a wet facecloth. Might recommend for comfort if you're not moving at all, but if you are doing any exercise or even brisk walking, I'd look for another option.",US,2020-07-24
2,Not great. Not good. Fit isn't right.,"The product is soft and comfortable. Still gets to be a bit warm but not unbearable. For me, he large is too small. The seam at the chin doesn't sit on my chin and I find myself constantly adjusting it. I bought one for my husband and the large fits him fine. Also, on mine the stitching is coming apart. I'm disappointed that and have continued my search for a better mask.",US,2020-10-28
2,Don't think it's made from bamboo,"The product is soft and the ear straps are adjustable. Unfortunately the material is so thin, when I breathe in, it goes into my nose. The material is too close to the face it fits so snug. Maybe if a person put a filter in that would help prevent sucking the material into your mouth or nose. I think it's made from a synthetic material too, not bamboo. That's misleading.",US,2020-10-24
2,Still fogs up glasses plus bad smell.,I bought this because it supposedly has a adjustable wire insert to mold the top of the mask to the contour of the nose. It has a wire insert but it's so springy that it doesn't hold it's shape and allows the top of the mask to fog up glasses. Like others have said it also has a bad smell. Wouldn't buy again.,US,2020-11-02
2,"Comfy, May or may not actually work.","Very comfortable, would give 5 stars but I wore this from my house to the airport 4 hour plane ride then drove home. Didn‚Äôt touch or talk to anyone except the TSA. I didn‚Äôt leave my house for 5 days after I got here and boom I got Corona. Now I have pneumonia on top of it.",US,2021-01-13
2,Nice look but absolutely useless,"I'm sure no-maskers would love this, it is very breathable, it doesn't even feel like you even have a mask on. However, this single layer of very thin and non-resistant fabric will probably not even do the job of protecting you. If you're looking to save yourself some thousands of dollars of medical care, invest your money in a better mask with double layers or better fabric. This mask is nowhere near worth $15.37. Just buy $8 worth of materials to make five masks that are better than this.",US,2020-07-19
2,Not what I expected,The mask is soft and fits ok but the material doesn‚Äôt make breathing easy. When inhaling the mask collapses to your mouth almost smothering you. I don‚Äôt have a problem with other masks and don‚Äôt feel like I am being smothered easily but this mask gives that feeling.,US,2020-07-29
2,"Recieved an obviously used mask, missing its tag + had multiple white stains!","This is the 3rd mask that I have purchased, the other 2, I was very happy with. They fit well and were light weight. This one though came in the original (unsealed) packaging without a tag and visible white stains. I don't even wanna think what they are. Most annoyed with the fact that I have to go out of may way to return an item that has obviously been used and abused in some way. Due to its nature and inconvenience I will not be doing business with them again. Only reason why I gave them 2 stars is that the other 2 masks were good. But lost my future business.",US,2020-10-25
2,Not enough structure to this mask,"This show be a good mask - however breathing in the fabric moves with every inhale.
I don‚Äôt like it.
While the fit and softness of the fabric was great- the fabric clings to your nose and mouth when you inhale.
I do not recommend.",US,2020-07-18
2,"Annoying Tag, but Great Comfort",I purchased a navy blue mask a month ago and loved it. Very comfortable and durable. So I deceived to get a black color so I could use this one at the gym and on work travel. When the item arrived I noticed that there is a huge tag on the front section of this mask and makes it extremely awkward. I‚Äôm hoping this is just a defect or something and maybe the company can provide me another so I don‚Äôt have to try to cut the tag and harm the structure of the mask. Very disappointed in the consistency between the two colors.,US,2020-09-03
2,Huge tag on outside mask.,"I would have given these masks 5 stars. This was the 3rd time I have purchased them. But this time there was a huge ‚Äúmade in... and how to wash tag‚Äù on the outside of mask. There is no way to remove the tag without ripping the seam. Why would
You put that huge tag on the mask. Whether the tag was on the outside or inside (which would rub
The skin) it makes no sense.",US,2021-01-06
2,These are best suited for people with a smaller face or for use in places where you don't talk.,The masks don't have enough room for chin movement while talking so the mask comes off my nose unless I hold it.,US,2020-07-01
2,"Good mask, sewn on tag is in a weird spot.","The mask overall is a really good mask! Easy to breath, doesn‚Äôt feel weird behind my ears, adjustable straps work perfect, and nose wire is there and works good. BUT, when it came the front of it had a tag that was sewn on the front of the mask and I had to cut it off but you can still see the white from where the tag was. Disappointed with that but otherwise it is a good mask.",US,2020-08-13
2,Steamy Glasses,"Product does not have a strong bendable nose clip. Therefore it is not good for those that wear glasses.
Also, maybe just me, but it made my face itch.",US,2020-10-17
2,Did not last long before tearing at seam,"Mask fits well but after only a couple weeks of occasional use, the inside lining is tearing away at the top seam where the metal strip goes over your nose. Overall, I was pleased with the mask until that happened. I would not purchase this product again.",US,2020-08-02
2,Meh...,A lot of money for something little. Stitching already coming undone after not too long...,US,2020-06-21
2,Holes appear in mask after 1 delicate wash,The masks are very comfortable. My kids love to wear them. We bought both the bamboo and cotton. The cotton masks hold up well but the bamboo started to show holes after just 1 delicate wash.,US,2020-08-17
2,Too small,The mask was too small and not as breathable as I expected. I‚Äôll see if my granddaughter wants it. Otherwise it‚Äôs going back.,US,2020-07-11
2,Fabric goes right into nose when you inhale,The material is Very soft but it goes right into your nose if you take any type of non shallow breath. Have to keep moving it to create a bubble of space so it doesn‚Äôt do that. I am returning. Plus overpriced in my opinion. They went from selling three for $14 to one for $14.,US,2020-07-11
2,This item is made in China. Needs to be in the product description.,I disliked the fact that I could not find what country produced this face mask. I bought it anyway without knowing and two things came up. There was only 1 mask when I could have sworn it said there were supposed to be five in a pack and now when I looked it up there was the question and answer where it said what country produced this product. UNSAT.,US,2020-07-08
2,Breaks after one wash,"Fine product, until you wash it and it starts to fall apart.",US,2020-06-14
2,Can‚Äôt breathe,"If you‚Äôre not worried about being able to breathe this mask is very soft- but talk at all or simply inhale and you feel as though you‚Äôre breathing through a plastic bag- I almost had an asthma attack only wearing it 20 minutes. It‚Äôs TOOOO soft, no structure. Disappointed:(",US,2020-08-05
2,Received mask with a hole in it!,Mask had a hole in it when I received it - so I never got to wear it! I‚Äôm going to try another one since this one was very soft and light weight but did seem a little flimsy. Not sure if it is really doing a good job of keeping particles out!,US,2020-07-03
2,Too small,It‚Äôs small. I don‚Äôt know why so many masks are one size fits all. Needs sizes,US,2020-07-13
2,Next,As someone else mention you continually suck in the inner fabric. It‚Äôs like wear a sheet on your face. It‚Äôs at least two ply and the two plies are not connected/sewn together if that makes sense. So while you can‚Äôt tell from the outside on the inside you are eating cloth.,US,2020-09-15
2,Mask is way small!!!,Mask is way to small and very cheaply made. Too small for an adult to wear.,US,2020-07-08
2,Poor Design.,"this is a 2 layer mask. unfortunately, they are not joined together well and the inner layer likes to try and choke you every time you inhale.",US,2020-12-05
2,Not sewn well,"This mask was very soft and I loved the adjustable straps for my ears. But after just 2 weeks of light wear, one of the straps ripped. Considering the price for one, I thought this would be better quality.",US,2020-08-04
2,Can‚Äôt talk or breathe when wearing this!,"I bought this for comfort, but it‚Äôs impossible to talk or breathe while wearing it because the fabric is so soft and delicate it is sucked into your mouth and nostrils when doing so. Definitely buy a mask with a bit more structure!",US,2020-06-27
2,"Nice mask, but . . . . paid for 3 and only received 2!","Happy with the masks we received, however, I am upset that I ordered and paid for 3 and only received 2 in the package. Can't get in touch with anyone to resolve. :(",US,2020-09-01

2,Not for a 6-year old,"My 6-year old didn‚Äôt like it. It was staying on head ok, bit since it‚Äôs so wide, her short hair got in her face all the time. And she hated the mouth cover - she didn‚Äôt want it up, but it was too uncomfortable while folded down. Cute design of her favorite panda is the only thing that gets 2 stars.",US,2020-01-30
2,Its okay.,Not what I expected. My 6 yr old didn't like it because the ears are droopy and don't stick straight up. Also I should have gotten adult size because toddler size fit snug.,US,2021-01-10
2,Smells so bad and had a hair on it!,It‚Äôs cute but has a terrible smell and had a hair on it which grossed me out! Bought it for my 3 year old daughter but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to put this on her. Disappointing!,US,2021-01-29

While the adjustable ear straps are great and work perfectly, the fabric portion (you know, the part that's supposed to protect you and others) is small. I'm a female, 5'4"" with an average size face for my size, and the mask moves around a ton when I talk because it's too small over the chin. The nose wire unfortunately does not help to keep it in place.

These masks also don't even come close to passing the ""light test."" I know you can put a filter in it. but the filters aren't very big, so I'd expect the whole mask to be more substantial.",US,2020-07-05
2,Thinner than expected,"I would not recommend these masks for the following reasons:
- Quality varies from mask to mask.
- The center seam is either stitched very well together or very poorly to where fabric bunches up or is loose.
- Material of mask is very thin and see-through even if it's 3 layers.
- You can tell it's thin on the lighter colorways.
- Colorways do not match the listing image.
- Might not be authentic Perry Ellis.

However, the nose wire (albeit very thin) makes it very glasses friendly because I did not experience any fogging.

It is worth noting that I am unsure of the authenticity of this product as it has a piece of paper that has Mandarin text on it with, what I'd assume to be, a stamp/seal of approval for the materials it uses? Never seen it before in stores likes Macy's but it definitely makes me think it's not a genuine article. Never seen it before in stores and it makes me think it might be a knock off that was made in China.",US,2020-11-12
2,Missing piece.,One of the mask is missing the ear adjustment piece. The product is fine otherwise. The reason I‚Äôm giving them a 2 star is the item is not returnable even with a missing piece.,US,2020-06-16
2,Slip down but good,"These masks are nice except they slip down every time I talk or move my mouth. I‚Äôve tried tightening the strings and the nose wire. If I tighten too much then my ears hurt. Besides that, they‚Äôre pretty good quality.

EDIT: the mask falling down is becoming SUPER annoying. I believe it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre too long. If I fold it right at my chin it won‚Äôt fall anymore but now the nose piece is too high. Poorly made, I can‚Äôt believe I have 6 of them now",US,2020-11-07
2,Other Masks Better Choice than These,Not made well. Missing clip adjusters on two of masks. And they shrunk even though washed in cold water and air dried.,US,2020-06-17
2,Well made but watch out if you wear glasses.,I am not a fan because they don‚Äôt work well with glasses. My husband loves them. Sure there is wire but it‚Äôs at an angle and doesn‚Äôt actually mold well like my other masks that I can wear with glasses. Good adjustable ear pieces.,US,2020-06-27
2,Doesn't Stay in Place,"Doesn't stay on well no matter how you adjust the straps. it will slide down your nose when you speak. Constantly having to adjust it is annoying to the point I rarely use these. They do fit the charcoal filters, and they look decent, but utility is limited. I know another gentleman I work with who also has these, and he complains about the same issue.",US,2020-10-07
2,Thin,"These are nice looking masks, but they are so thin! You will have to put paper filters in to feels safe. You can almost see through them, which is not good enough to stop the droplets from getting through! I would return them but I washed them and have worn one of them.",US,2020-08-18
2,Very disappointing,These are nice looking masks until you wash them. They become extremely wrinkled and need to be ironed to look decent. They are also very difficult to breathe in. The material sucks in and blocks your nostrils or mouth. Not good for long time wear. Do not order these masks.,US,2020-12-16
2,Waste of money,"These are awful and a waste of money. Washed them before using, and they shrank to a children‚Äôs size. They cannot be pure Cotten. Another Chinese ripoff.",US,2020-07-06
2,package contained 5 not 6,"I've ordered these before and liked them. However my second order came with 5 masks not 6.
It's too much of pain to return and I've already ripped the packaging, so I'll just keep, and take the loss. Is that what they're counting on us doing? I'm wondering.
I'm noticing this seems to be an Amazon trend....pictures and descriptions not matching the received amounts, etc.
Fix this or we're going elsewhere to purchase.",US,2020-11-12
2,Ugh another uncomfortable mask,Feels like I‚Äôm suffocating. I can‚Äôt talk in it because it moves. All masks so far are like this so it‚Äôs not like this is unique. It‚Äôs nice that they are adjustable and washable.,US,2020-07-08
2,"Don‚Äôt buy if you are petite, mask are too big!","The mask are nice and soft. But it‚Äôs says 1 size fits all. That‚Äôs not true. The mask are too big on my face, too loose. The mask doesn‚Äôt really work very well on me because too big and loose. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt them. I guess I wasn‚Äôt my money",US,2020-12-09
2,"Comfortable, but you don‚Äôt necessarily get what you ordered","Good sizing and comfortable adjustable ear loops. But the nose wire on a couple of them is so thin, that the end keeps poking your face no matter how you shape it. And, although the photo of the assortment shows florals, stars, etc. the actual set I received was completely different to what I ordered.",US,2021-01-02
2,Wrong print.,I was looking forward to getting cute printed masks and ended up getting completely different printed ones. Not even one of them looked like the one I chose.,US,2020-11-03
2,Just okay,Like the adjustable straps but overall poor quality. Seams are not centered in front and some stitching is coming undone after washing by hand the first time.,US,2020-11-02
2,Not as expected,The colors I received are not the same as what is pictured! I would not have purchased them if they pictured what I actually received. I also expected to receive the real Perry Ellis brand but these are not which I feel is deceiving!,US,2020-12-22
2,"Too small, too thin","Nice material, but not thick enough to do any good. Too small for adult face. When I talk it rides up or down. If it was a little bigger and had a layer of quilting cotton lining these would be great.",US,2020-12-20
2,Very poorly made :(,"Got them today and put them to be washed. The blue one had the color fade and the other just started to rip!
Not worth the money!!!",US,2020-06-25
2,Uncomfortable,Very hard to breed,US,2021-01-12

2,Runs large,Too big on my face...way too much fabric,US,2021-02-05
2,Average quality,Masks tend to lose shape after washing.,US,2020-07-02
2,Not A Good Fit,"I thought purchasing a cotton mask would fit more snug since I have a petite face; however, that was not the case. The mask was too big (even after washing and drying) and the material too thin. I wouldn't recommend purchasing.",US,2021-01-30
2,They Don't Hold Up After Washing,These masks started to unravel after washing them one time. They are very comfortable to wear but are not durable.,US,2020-08-22
2,Cheap,"Doesn't stay in place when talking. Fogs up glasses even after attaching a nose band. Cheaply made (yeah, you get what you pay for) and already falling apart after only a few wears.",US,2020-08-24
2,Too narrow,Quality is nt very good but the price is good. These are small and very narrow.,US,2020-06-28
2,cant breath,shrinks after washing. I cannot breath in this mask,US,2020-11-11
2,Search for other masks,I did not like them as much. They were very cheap material. I wouldn't have bought them if I knew they would be as bad.,US,2021-01-13
2,Sizing seems off,"These fit very tight around my ears, so I ended up giving them away. It might be that my ears are set back further than average? I don‚Äôt know.",US,2020-08-20
2,Shrank...,These shrank enough that no one in my family will wear them now. :-(,US,2020-09-11
2,"Arrived fast, but incomplete.","Contacted seller because one of the valves parts was missing. Instead of offering to send a replacement and send back this incomplete item, they decided to tell me to search for a valve set online and they would credit me 10dol. This is NOT good customer service. The valve replacement costs 13 plus shipping. I do not want a set of valves.. for ""in case it breaks or parts go missing in the future"" I want a. full complete mask, and I paid over 25 dol. to get a decent mask! Also, for me it is great fit, for my husband it falls down a bit when talking (slightly too small) but if he folds the bottom part it fits. It looks like a great mask, good quality and very breathabe... Overall not pleased at all because of the incomplete order And the inefficient solution"".",Canada,2020-07-21
2,Not suitable for woodworking,"Well, to begin with I bought this mask primarily for woodworking and my review will be based on that. I‚Äôll start with recommendation not to buy it if this is the case because this mask never meant to be for a woodworker maybe it‚Äôs good for the other reasons listed there but surely they shouldn‚Äôt promoting as good product for woodworking. I have been using this mask for like a week or so to give this product a fair judgment. It makes your protection glasses foggy and it‚Äôs not fully covering your nose and mouth and you still can breathe the dustsaw. So to end with if you‚Äôre getting this product for using it in workshop then I highly recommend to look for another product.",Canada,2020-09-18
2,If you're a average to large size man this will not fit you.,"I gave it two stars cuz it says one size fits most and I'm now the fourth person I know that this doesn't fit. I bought it on a hope and a prayer I could do something with it because other masks give me a headache from pulling the tip of my nose down and was super disappointed to find out this mask is not a viable option. I'm a big guy, so, it really was a long shot it would fit, but, after trying it on myself I realize just how untrue it is when they say ""one size fits most"". So, please be aware, if you're male and I'd say 5'10"" 200 lbs and up this isn't going to fit you. At all. I'm 6'2"" 255 just for the record.",Canada,2020-08-03
2,Buyer Beware,"The product fits nicely... and is GREAT when playing sports.

I bought the mask first to test it out... liked it, and ended up investing heavily into it... bought masks for the whole family, and even another package of spare filters etc. All in all, I spent well over $200 in these masks.

They are comforable for the most part. If you have a smaller or narrow face, I find that they stick out from your face a lot and look strange.

That being said, these are all now sitting on a shelf, and we no longer use them.

Why? Well... you cannot enter many places with a vented mask. Midst the pandemic, I wanted to buy the BEST protection I could without breaking the bank... now we are back to using the generic paper disposable masks until I find something new.

These are GREAT for cycling, running, and if you are playing sports of any kind.

They are NOT recommended if you plan on using it as your daily mask... as you won't be able to get into several places with them due to the vents.

Since there was no disclosure of this in the sales cycle, I took 1 star off... 1 also took off a star for the look on a narrow face... and one further star because of the value of the product they are expensive for what you get).",Canada,2020-12-18
2,Falls/slides off nose. Ear elastics not adjustable.,"I was really looking forward to receiving this mask but when I tried it on I was quickly disappointed. The quality of the material is great but the way the mask is designed causes it to slowly slip off your nose (and yes, I pinched the nose clip tightly!) because the strap around the back of your neck pulls the mask downward and the ear elastics are too loose/not adjustable. I played around with it for quite some time and even installed the supplied nose pads but they just end up pinching my nostrils shut so that I can't breathe through my nose. My wife also tried it and has the same problems. We have different size heads and noses (me: large head, medium nose, her: small head, small nose) and the problem is the same.

This would have been a 5-star review if it wasn't for these problems because they make the mask both uncomfortable and unusable for me. I will be returning it.",Canada,2020-09-03
2,Great Idea poor design,"I boght this mask because the other masks I use for my job fog up my glasses, this mask doesn't let your breath fog up your glasses. When it is in place properly. But due to the design of the mask, it pulls itself down off of your face.",Canada,2020-06-13
2,Hm.,"It's not made for adults, not made for sports either. The mask keep sliding down your nose making it hard to breath through your nostrils. The ear hangers ain't helping it stay in place. The *nose bender* ( thing you can fold on the noise) is very good compared to many other masks but they need to make it slightly bigger, maybe 2 inches each side for it to be a good product.",Canada,2020-09-09
2,Wouldn't recommend,"The fit is quite ugly...makes one look like they have a duck's bill on their face and it's not flexible or malleable to flatten it out. The covers for the air holes came off after the first wash. Supposed to help prevent fogging up the glasses, but it doesn't.

Definitely not a product for long term use and I would not recommend you waste your money.",Canada,2021-01-06
2,"A $27 dust mask, should not be falling apart within one hour of it being used.","It was very uncomfortable and my eyeglasses started fogging up even with the 2 vents in this model. An hour yesterday, was it took for this mask to start falling apart when the vent on it just opened up and then fell right out of the material. Which the outer part of the vent went down a sewer drain.

These masks are obviously not made very well if mine starts losing parts from the $27 that I paid for it?",Canada,2020-07-30
2,Mask falls off my nose while talking,Product is quite secure after donning it but once I get talking with people while the mask is on it begins to fall off my nose leading to several adjustments while wearing same. I also think this gives me kinda a runny nose experience due to the constant tampering with the diameter of my nose-canal. Not sure if most Caucasians would have same problem though due to their nose shape (not being racist here). For $29 I think I should have just stuck with a good number of the more common nose masks.,Canada,2020-11-04
2,Disappointed with my second purchase,"Second time purchasing this as I gave my first one to my dad and he loved it. Unfortunately, the second mask I purchased was missing a nose valve and had to buy replacement nose valve costing me more. Even though the mask is good I‚Äôm just disappointed the second time around.",Canada,2020-08-02
2,"If you think the mask might be too small for you, don't even try","The mask is literally painful to wear to whoever has a face longer than what the mask is designed for. there is no adjustment on the mask for a face's length nor for ears height. if it fits, good for you, if it doesn't, request a refund.",Canada,2020-08-05
2,Uncomfortable,Nice mask but unfortunately very uncomfortable for me. Specifically around the nose piece. It tends to put a lot of pressure on the nose no matter how it‚Äôs adjusted. All personal preference Ofcourse.,Canada,2020-12-27
2,Slides off my nose.,"Slides off my nose and needs constant adjustment. Government nanny's suggest I not touch my mask while I'm wearing it. I have an average size nose and a larger size head because of my height. Perhaps these are ""Asian Fit"" as other manufacturers use as descriptors?",Canada,2020-09-06
2,Not appropriate for COVID,"This mask is designed for working in a dusty shop. It is not designed for COVID. Health experts advise is that the filters make it so the wearer spreads their own germy exhale freely.

Plus the mask is bulking, heavy, and uncomfortable. Not good for all day use.

Do not buy if you are looking for a COVID protection.",Canada,2020-11-26
2,Doesn't hold in place for long,"The mask velcros in place lower down on the back of the head, so it offers very little support. It's made very large and easily slips down my face despite tightening it to an almost uncomfortable level. Nothing seems to make it hold in place.

However, I will admit that when it is in place, it's very comfortable, but it doesn't last long before it starts to slip.

I would not recommend buying this product.",Canada,2020-09-29
2,Not happy.,"The Filter inserts in the mask aren‚Äôt very well secured. Lost one of the plastic covers after only a few times wearing this. So renders the product useless now. I really liked the fit and the Velcro strap, but for the amount of times I‚Äôve used it, a big waste of money.",Canada,2020-07-31
2,"Great concept, poor fit.","The product does not fit tight to my face. It is tight under my chin but with the head strap on, it puckers out from around my nose. When breathing, all my exhaled air comes up from the mask into my eyes rather than going through the filter. I think if used with ear loops instead of the head strap, it would be much more comfortable and effective. Returned product.",Canada,2020-07-04
2,Don't waste your money.,Majority of mask is a wide open mesh. It does not form a seal on the face so the filters and the filter breathing holes aren't really utilized. Most of the air goes out the sides. Horribly designed mask.,Canada,2020-07-12
2,Mislead on what came in the package,"So I'm writing this review because I didnt recieve what I was told I was receiving. The product came yesterday and I opened it today. The mask itself is great looks feels and seems perfect but the ad said it came with 7 filters I only got 5, it said 7 nose strips I received 4 and it said 4 cents and I only got 2. Very dissappointed and since I'm a newbie to amazon I dont know who or how to complain to anyone.",Canada,2020-09-22
2,Not made to last,Mask is a bit small for larger faces the vent holes are cut too big so the vent covers sometimes detach if mask is stretched I dunno if it‚Äôs just mine. Overall quality not impressed.,Canada,2020-07-30
2,Wasn't impressed.,For the price this particular brand does not cut it. I ended up returning this one and opted for the same mask made by another company and I'm glad I did.,Canada,2020-09-18
2,Meh. A below par purchase,The Idea is great. It fits decently but tugs and makes it hard to move your head around. The filters are garbage and wont fit properly into the mask. Wouldn't buy again.,Canada,2020-10-13
2,Not very durable with connections,I ordered four face masks for my grown-up kids and soon all of them lost the two plastic filter connections as shown in the attached photo. The product does not seem to be very durable with respect to the connection points. Once you lose these connections the masks become useless.,Canada,2020-10-03
2,HAIR ON FILTER,"the mask itself is fine but i have a problem with the filter. this filter was already attatched to the mask when i opened it, and it looks like beard hair on it. the other 2 filters in the bag did not have these hairs. i feel like i got a used one or a returned item. it would be nice if i can get replacement filter for the used one i received. t",Canada,2020-08-26
2,nope.,"Super cheap quality. Filter tabs fell off after one day. Now there is a 1"" hole in the front of the mask. So basically this was an expensive disposable mask...",Canada,2020-07-26
2,great but my not be suitable for many hearing aid wearers,"I had to return this item as it's not suitable for me as I wear behind the ear hearing aids. The mask, otherwise it us quite a good mask.",Canada,2020-09-15
2,Valve opening too big for valve,"I have one of these from another supplier.
That one is perfect and I should have bought from them but I decided to save some money and bought this one.
I like it but they cut one of the valve openings too big.
I don‚Äôt have all the stuff so I‚Äôm not returning it but I wouldn‚Äôt buy from them again",Canada,2020-07-24
2,Did not fit very well. Fogged up like other masks,I was disappointed with this product. I was not able to wear it while exercising as it had all the restrictions of other masks. Difficult to quickly pull it on and off. Costly for what it is.,Canada,2020-10-28
2,Difficult to insert filters,Got TWO filters only. Not that well made as there are lots of frayed ends. Would not buy again.,Canada,2020-08-21
2,Bad smell,Filters had a very bad smell to them ended up buying replacement filters Threw the other ones out,Canada,2020-08-09
2,Too small,"It's decent quality and I like the idea but it's too small for my face, would never have ordered if I had known how small. Disappointed.",Canada,2021-02-02
2,Not very good.,Small. Uncomfortable and chafes your nose like crazy. The straps make it sit awkwardly,Canada,2020-08-15

2,"It is not adjustable at the ears, hard to wear all day",It is very heavy for a daily use. It keeps pushing my ears forward and I finish with pain at the end of the day. The only advantage is that it does not fog my glasses,Canada,2020-08-27
2,Too expensive for the quality.,It‚Äôs an okay mask.. it seems as if they didn‚Äôt take their time since the holes don‚Äôt line up very well and the filter things look uneven. I definitely would not recommend for the price. You‚Äôre better off just buying a basic one.,Canada,2020-07-20
2,Non comfortable.,The mask slides down towards my mouth and it‚Äôs hard to keep it in place. It‚Äôs not as comfortable as I expected. And the first time I washed it the clip on the nose came out. I‚Äôm very disappointed on this item.,Canada,2020-10-25

2,Decent mask,Good mask but unable to talk with. On as the mask gets pulled down as you talk. Also the neck strap eventually makes the neck sore when wearing for long periods of time.,Canada,2020-09-26
2,Wouldn't trust my life over this.. Not good quality.,"Honestly as you can see from the pictures, simply horrible in quality. Also extremely uncomfortable around the nose. I don't think they figured out how to make it safe, tight, and comfy at the right balance.",Canada,2020-07-23
2,Valves are the problem,Valves keep popping out eventually lost one now mask is useless. Not at all empressed for the price.,Canada,2020-08-26

2,Very dissapointed,"Really dissapointed, too hot, tendency to always fall off my face, heavy, filter become rapidly dirty, loss one breathing capsule at one point. Only good point is the design is nice.",Canada,2020-08-06
2,Durability is the problem,This mask is not very durable and will not stand up to even moderate physical training. I've had this for only a couple weeks and one of the little filter vents has completely broken and will not reinstall.,Canada,2020-08-23
2,Not a solid product,"They should include extra black breathing caps as the untwist and fall out easily.
Lost one side and now mask useless.",Canada,2020-10-19

2,Not Happy,The part is broken ...,Canada,2020-08-15
2,Not medical grade,The black plastic pieces are not filters. They do nothing but hold the layers together. These masks do not protect at all.,Canada,2020-08-22
2,Not comfortable.,I wanted somethign to wear at work for long periods of time and this is not it. Wasted money.,Canada,2020-08-25
2,not as advertised,"Didn't get what they showed, good product but not as advertised.",Canada,2020-08-19
2,Poor quality,"This mask is poor quality for the money that I paid for it. The filters fell out almost immediately upon opening the package, and you immediately see that it looks like the holes for those filters were afterthoughts that had been ripped through the material rather than professionally cut. I expected the holes to be like any holes in fabric that would be reinforced somehow so that the tearing wouldn't get worse over time, not jagged cuts that are slightly too large so they often go over-the-top of the filters themselves.

The plastic filter-covers themselves also twist off far too easily. They don't have anything to lock them in place so if you have the mask in your pocket it is very easy to have them fall off when you remove it.

Essentially I'm saying the build quality is very poor all around and I don't recommend buying this mask.",US,2020-07-30
2,Not a comfortable fit...,"For me this is very uncomfortable - because of the shape and this is dictated largely by the internal filter insert, it simply doesn‚Äôt fit fully. If I position it on the bridge of the nose I can‚Äôt get it to fit over my chin. Also because of the shape of the rear strap, it is too low and therefore pulls your ears down and out, and the strap goes right at the bottom of your head (almost the neck) which means it‚Äôs constantly pulling down. Feels really uncomfortable and no way I can wear it.
I would have liked the front to be flatter as well as when the filter is fixed into the two vents it forces the shape into a pointy front but which looks odd.",US,2020-09-10
2,Not Good,"From the ratings I expected these masks to be better than they are. Am I doing something wrong as the statement that you can wear glasses, and they won't steam up is wrong as they do steam up? As far the filers, they only seem to work on half the mask so you have to use 2 at a time, again I ask am I doing something wrong as the instruction seem to be gobbledygook or maybe me. They now sit on a chair not used.",US,2020-09-14
2,Not suitable for large head/face,"The product seems to be actually very good for the money, however it does seem to be more designed for children. It will not cover both my nose and chin at the same time and the piece of metal to stop glasses from steaming does not seem to work.",US,2020-09-17
2,Very uncomfortable,"I don't understand the great reviews for this product (which aided my purchase).

The fitting (and I have completely normal features!) is terrible - it sits painfully on the nose when fit securely, and when loosened slightly the mask still feels uncomfortable sat on the bridge of the nose and slides down your entire nose eventually.

Not a a great product at all, and not what I was expecting. Chose wisely.",US,2021-01-20
2,"Avoid this seller, incorrect and misleading advert and ignore attempts to contact them.","Not as advertised. Seller replied to first contact and apologised for incorrect advert, said they would correct it and offered a part refund. I accepted but seems later no refund and they have ignored my last 2 chasers. This kind of seller should be removed from a trusted site like Amazon, it is not the reputation they should want!",US,2020-07-08
2,Hurts the ears,"The loop for the ears do not really reach my ears very well, and wearing the mask for a minute feels like I've worn it for hours, it hurts.
The velcro straps don't really assist either.
It's a shame, as the quality of every other part is decent, the filters are fine, and the mask would be comfortable if the ear loops were in the right place/adjustable.",US,2020-07-20
2,Not for me,"I didnt realise this mask has a large strap that goes around the back of the head. Based on tbe placement of the velcro strips, this mask is not suitable for people with small/normal heads and necks.

Also, compared to disposable surgical masks or N95s, it is more difficult to breathe in the mask perhaps because it is quite thick and it gets very steamy in it.",US,2020-07-21
2,"Move along, nothing to see here.",Not particularly comfortable as the filter tends to ride up against your face. You can't use without the filter as the valves won't attach to the mask as the holes are unfinished and stretch too much. If you wear glasses this is hopeless as the nose bridge is too thick and won't sit under them.,US,2020-08-30
2,Astro Al reusable face mask No,This is good only if you have a very big face or maybe huge ears!! Honestly! Waste of money! Don‚Äôt buy!! It keeps falling off my face and and too big for my ears! I also bought one for my husband he‚Äôs quite big but still slightly sliding off his face and ears! I don‚Äôt know why holes for???,US,2020-08-15
2,Not great,"It‚Äôs a good mask in terms of quality. However if you where this for longer than 20 minutes, it will likely be uncomfortable. I‚Äôve also found it makes my nose burn after awhile of breathing through it. I‚Äôd personally give something else a try.",US,2020-10-27
2,Not a good fit. Binned it!,"I was drawn to this mask by the adjustable neck band. Seemed like a better idea than those with elastic behind ears.
Unfortunately, the neck band was too long, and when snugly adjusted there was a long velcro flap sticking out. Not going to use it. Can't give it away. So it's in the bin!",US,2020-08-16
2,Too Small,Restrictive. Hurts the bridge of my nose but loosening the strap at the neck causes it to fall off. Not any good for a 6ft man maybe small women or kids.. Definitely not one size fits all,US,2020-10-16
2,Expensive and poorly made,My problem with this product was that the filters on the side fell out which basically made the product useless. Sent back for a refund as I felt it was quite expensive for what it was,US,2020-07-31
2,Bought as breathable mask for current situation,Was looking for a Covid 19 mask for my husband who struggles to breathe through various masks. Had not appreciated this was just a dust mask with one way valve. Take care if buying it fits your purpose. Well made otherwise.,US,2020-09-06
2,Not what i had hoped for,"I was looking for a more comfortable mask for shopping, these feel great but when wearing for longer than 10 minutes its really hard to breath (That's me more then the masks they are well made)",US,2020-10-05
2,"Poor fitting mask, waste of money",This mask simply doesn't fit me. There's no way I can make the ear loops go over my ears when the straps are tied and it rides down my face as a result. Basically it's too small for my face shape. Wasted money.,US,2020-10-02
2,ability to breath easily and difficulty to use my spectcals,"The face mask is not suitable for peoples like me as the materials are thick which affected my breathing and even the presence of filters didn't help much as I am asthmatic
The bridge over the nose didn't help and even removing it didn't help also as the material is thick enough which makes using my specticals vey difficult",US,2020-10-18
2,Good but not!,"This mask was really comfy and easy to use, but the cheap plastic sections that make up the ‚Äòfilter‚Äô come apart too easily and fall off rendering it redundant not long after purchase.",US,2020-09-26
2,"Expensive, not perfect","Within one week one of the filters fell out due to its loose fitting, a bit warm to wear in hot weather also, should have bought cheaper alterantive",US,2020-08-26
2,Not as advertised,Product is of poor quality the mechanism that hold the inner .ask to the outer mask keep popping inside the outer mask like the wholes are to big,US,2020-08-19
2,Very hard to breathe with this on!,Well made but the inner is hard to breathe through which makes it a useless waste of money,US,2020-10-01
2,Was good but broke,Great mask but after a few weeks one of the plastic filter caps fell off and so now it‚Äôs useless. Shame as it was a good mask whilst it lasted,US,2020-08-21
2,Dissapointed,"I thought this would be good but as like many others you have to keep pulling it up over your nose.
This is what i wanted to avoid but hense no.",US,2020-10-17
2,Seems decent but too small,Bought this as I needed to use public transport/go shopping in the middle of lockdown. Unfortunately it is far too small for my face and I have ended up using a bandanna instead. Would be great for a child or someone with a smaller head.,US,2020-08-20
2,Disappointing,"Looks great, quality made, extras included, but when it comes to fit, poor I'm afraid.
It keeps sliding down my nose and off, no matter how I adjust it, it seems to not have enough material around the nose area, big shame as I wanted a quality mask I wouldn't have to keep changing. Disappointed!",US,2021-01-24
2,Too small for the average adult.,Small size. More for a teenager or small child. Just that bit small for adult.,US,2020-07-12
2,Not really worth ¬£25,"Got to say for ¬£25 I was expecting something of better quality, the filter is well not much of a filter.

The quality is ok but not what you would expect for the price.

I think most of the money is spent on the bag that it comes in!",US,2020-08-01

IMO a poorly made product. Not recommended.",US,2020-09-01

2,Not bad not great,"Nose clip broke 1st time wearing, not the most comfortable",US,2020-09-10
2,Cheaply made mask for expensive price,"Really thin cheap material, the detachable nose clip isn‚Äôt detachable and digs right into your nose when your wearing it making it extremely uncomfortable to wear for any amount of time",US,2020-07-09
2,Not worth it,Very very hard to breathe through. The air flow points do not work. Turned it both ways and still no good!,US,2020-10-24
2,cheap and poorly made,"very cheap, one of the filters had ripped in two before i even opened the packet. made for realy fat heads aswell",US,2020-07-12
2,Not ideal,"Too big for my face, it doesn‚Äôt stick well on the back of the neck.",US,2021-02-02
2,Does not fit over nose (don't even have a big nose ü§®),Mask should work well but does not say over your face. As you move or talk it slides down your face from your nose. There is the nose bridge you can pinch but does not have any effect.,US,2020-07-10
2,No comfort or flexibility,"Doesn't fit well on me. No flexibility around the face, inside filte ripped first time opening my mouth",US,2020-12-20
2,Wasted money,Would be great but too tight a fit even when loose on doesn't sit on the nose at all disappointed,US,2020-10-28

2,Keine FFP2 Maske!,"Bei dieser Maske wird leider nicht in der Produktbeschreibung erw√§hnt, dass es sich nicht um eine FFP2-Maske handelt. Dies erf√§hrt man erst, wenn man die Gebrauchsanweisung liest. Das finde ich nicht gut und kann K√§ufer sehr leicht in die Irre f√ºhren. Ansonsten ist der Tragekomfort gut dank des Nackenriemens. Jedoch dichtet der Nasenclip nicht gut ab und nur mit den mitgelieferten Polstern ist dies erreichbar.

2,Disappointed,"The great thing is, it doesn't hurt behind the ears.
But with a slightly bigger nose like mine, you'd think it wouldn't slip, but it does, actually making it harder for me to breathe through my nose in the process, even with the memory foam slice applied to the nose section.

Also, you constantly drool on your clothes or things in front of you, because the moisture caught in the filter chambers drips out, which is very disgusting.",Germany,2021-01-13
2,Nicht so gut,"Ich habe diese Maske gekauft, weil alle schrieben die Brille w√ºrde nicht mehr so beschlagen und sie sei bequem.
Beides ist nicht der Fall, habe alle m√∂glichen Justierungen getestet, nichts zu machen.

2,Maske bequem riecht aber massiv nach Chemie,"Ich habe die Maske jetzt seit November und muss sagen:
Posetiv: Maske sitzt gut und man bekommt hut Luft.
Negativ: Die Maske riecht massiv nach Chemie sodass ich sie erstmal f√ºr ein paar Tage auf dem Balkon l√ºften musste, ansonsten h√§tte ich Kopfschmerzen bekommen und die runden Filter fallen heraus.",Germany,2020-12-23
2,Really Disappointed,"Despite stating in the description that it prevents fogging and is ideal for people wearing glasses, on the contrary, it fogs them even more even in normal circumstances when you do not exert that much e.g. if you are sitting in a bus or walking at a normal pace.
Since this item can not be returned, it makes the situation worse. Really disappointed!",Germany,2020-12-16
2,non soddisfatto,"preme troppo sul naso, il nasello non √® allineato con i due bottoni a pressione che ne deformano l'aspetto, se si stringe troppo il velcro dietro diventa insopportabile, se si lascia troppo lento si annulla la sua funzione di filtro",Italy,2021-01-15
2,Ventile fallen raus.,"1 Stern Abzug wegen zu teurem Preis.
Ganz schlecht sind aber die Beiden Ventile. Die l√∂sen sich zu leicht. Hatte die Maske im Rucksack, und es fehlte ein Ventil. Habe es aber wiedergefunden.
Habe dann die Ventile mit Sekunden Kleber zusammengef√ºgt. So kann man aber keine neuen Filter einsetzen. Also f√ºr den Preis nicht zumutbar.
Der einzige Vorteil ist, dass man durch die Maske gut atmen kann, ohne die Filter.",Germany,2020-10-07
2,F√ºr mich sehr unbequem,"Ich habe vielleicht nicht den 08/15 Kopf; auf jeden Fall sitzt die Maske nicht so gut bei mir. Die Ohrb√ºgel dr√ºcken schon ordentlich und der Nasenb√ºgel ist nutzlos. Ich nutze die Maske nicht, weil das zu unpraktisch ist, gerade als Brillentr√§ger.",Germany,2020-12-29

2,Women and Children Only - no choice of size,"Mainly it's just too small - I checked the packaging to see if I had accidentally ordered a child size, or Small size - it seems one size is 'meant' to fit all. But I don't think this will fit an average man's face.

The ear loops are too restrictive pulling down my ears if I try to use them.

The velcro only just touches at the back of the neck - I promise I'm not a sumo wrestler or weight lifter or anything like that ;-)

The 'removable' nose clip is not really removable - no instructions - thought they were studs that would come apart easily, but seems to be fixed one piece of plastic - pulling from the mask leaves 2 small holes - not great.

Because the mask is so tight it feels so restrictive I'm not sure I can manage even my small 25 minute commute.

You have to be very careful tightening the vents - they rely on the filter cloth being in place to wedge them tightly in place - they don't hold together otherwise.

In other ways it seems nicely made and packaged, so 2 stars if you have a tiny enough head for them to fit you.",US,2020-06-20
2,Unschl√ºssig ob gut oder nicht,"Filter nur anliegend nicht in einer tasche eingef√ºgt somit wird er du atem schnell feucht und unbrauchbar.

Halterungen und klett fur mich mehr als ausreichend lang und angenehm anliegend.

Trotzdem etwas teuer vorallem da es das selbe modell hier auch billiger gibt. Ob da die Qualit√§t gleich ist zeigt sich.",Germany,2020-07-24
2,Fell apart after three Uses,"After three uses, the air valve popped off while I was wearing it! The mask had not been washed or pulled or mishandled in any way. I was In a large crafts store when the right side air valve popped out and fell onto the floor leaving an uncovered hole near my mouth and nose. I tried to put the valve back in the hole but realized I was cross contaminating my face with my unwashed hands so I took the mask off to repair it. I‚Äôm standing in the aisle frantically trying to put the valve back in the hole when I realized I was now in a busy store full of customers and I had no mask on. I always wear a face mask and use hand sanitizers in public places. I bought two of these face masks because of the supposedly greater protection, comfort and breathability. But it broke at the most crucial entry point to my face! I felt very compromised and at risk of getting the Coronavirus by this face mask‚Äôs malfunction. I would not buy the AstroAl product again.",US,2020-06-30
2,F√ºr Brillentr√§ger nur bedingt geeignet,"Die Maske sitzt nicht gut und schliesst im Nasenbereich schlecht ab. Das hat zur Folge, dass auch bei h√∂heren Temperaturen bereits die Brille beschl√§gt. Nicht daran zu denjen, wie das erst im Winter sein wird.

Das Nackenband mit dem Klett sorgt eher daf√ºr, dass die Maske noch schlechter sitzt, weil es die Maske nach unten zieht.

Die Filter sind eine Katastrophe. Versucht mal, die auf die Lippen zu pressen und Luft durchzupusten. Viel zu undurchl√§ssig, daher atmet man nicht DURCH den Filter, sondern daran vorbei.",Germany,2020-08-30
2,Misleading Description,"Mine only came with 3 filter elements,3 foam pads and no replacement valves.
Calling the nose bridge adjustable is an overstatement as it is slightly adjustable but not to the point of a snug fit, hence the need for the foam pads . Mine is also riveted and NOT removable unless I destroy the mask.
Only reason I'm not returning or giving a 1 star is it is very long term comfortable during the day and least restrictive on air inhalation while I'm doing heavy labor at work. I normally wear a neck gator as a dust inhibitor but lately the mold count is off the charts so I need more to keep my allergies to as much of a minimum as possible.
The mesh outer shell is much more comfortable in the humid summer air than the neoprene I've used in the past.
If you're looking for something long term or need excellent sealing this is not the way to go. There are others that fit much better but at a much higher cost now that Covid 19 restrictions are required. Before Cooties I got a very very good fitting mask for half the cost of even this one but it was stolen while I was on vacation and until recently 95 masks were almost impossible to find but now they're readily available but at thrice the price of this time last year.
I highly recommend Base Camp for only a few dollars more or RZ (the one that got stolen ) at twice the price but best fit I've ever owned .",US,2020-08-22
2,Disappointing,"Does not function well even as a dust mask. Nose piece is not sufficiently stiff to properly mold around wearer's nose. Result: Unacceptable dust intrusion between nose & cheeks.

Neck strap is not effective in maintaining a tight fit if wear moves head up or down. Better engineering would be dual head straps, one above behind crown of head and one around back of head.

Exhaust valves work well, but rest of design seriously falls short.",US,2020-06-28
2,Durable Design But Exhalation Valves Tend to Fall Off,"These masks seem very durable and are reasonable comfortable to wear. However, despite having a stiff plastic clamp over the nose piece, they don't completely seal over your nose which will tend to make your glasses to fog up. I realize that's an issue with a lot of masks, but as these are molded to fit over your nose and are designed with the nose piece clamp, I would have expected them to work better in that respect. But the big issue I have with these masks is that the exhalation valves tend to loosen over time and fall off. The valves are in two pieces, one inside and the other outside the mask, and you twist the outside about a quarter turn to ""lock"" the two pieces together. I have had to reinstall one of the valves several times, and after a couple of months of use, I have finally lost one of them, thereby rendering the mask as useless. I wish I had thought to glue the two pieces together on both of my masks the first time I noticed that issue.",US,2021-01-02
2,"Poor craftsmanship, not the most comfortable","Mixed feelings on this. It seems to be fixed more for a child. The back strap is kind of uncomfortable in that it tends to pull down the mask and this puts more pressure on the nose. Speaking of the nose, the ‚Äúcushion‚Äù is a small strip you have to glue to the mask which I felt was a bit lazy on their part since it is easy to just come off again and somewhat too large a strip so unless you‚Äôre buying this for a rhino, be prepared to cut it down some. The two filter pockets were also not symmetrical on the mask which just makes it look even more cheap and sloppy when you wear it. Gonna exchange to see if the replacement is better otherwise will get the refund. Keep y‚Äôall posted!",US,2020-09-22
2,Meh...,"The very first time I wore it one of the vent faces fell off unnoticed, so I had a big hole in my mask. Not exactly what I was wanting.
Contacted seller who refunded $10 and sent me the link to order replacement vents for $16, so out more money but now have 20 valves (whoopee).
The replacements seem to lock better, why don't they just use them instead of the cheapies that came with the mask?
The strap on the back of your head is way to big/awkward, the ear straps don't appear to do really anything. The mask rubs against the bridge of my nose, after about 15 min becomes pretty uncomfortable.
Probably just going to toss it in the trash. The price is way too high for what ended up being a pretty low quality and low comfort piece of cloth & plastic.",US,2020-08-04
2,Filters fall out easily and won't stay up if talking,"I like the design of this and was hoping it would be good for wearing throughout the day but it came up short. I used it for 5 hours a day for 5 days.
Pros
- Looks good, had a good amount of people ask about it
- keeps my glasses from getting fogged and that is the only reason it is getting 2 stars instead of one
Cons
- The nose piece is uncomfortable and does not stay in place. After a day of wearing it, I had a sore on the bridge of my nose. If you talk or laugh with this you will need to reposition it.
- The 2 front plastic filters fell out the first day I had it. It was embarrassing to be talking with someone and the little plastic filter falls out. I had to glue them in place after the 1st day of usage.
- Expensive for something that does not stay in place, filters fall out and not comfortable on the nose.",US,2020-08-11
2,Promising but completely useless,"I liked the look and feel - though it is harder to breathe in these than a cloth or medical mask.

WARNING - these are not allowed at airports, hostpitals or other major public areas because they do NOT prevent you from spreading virus or germs. Your exhales make it out into the air around you.

Design flaw - the velcro strap is good in theory, but being on the bottom of the strap system makes it pull down the mask and put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on your nose bridge.

I'll still use it while mowing the lawn or landscaping in high allergy season, but wouldn't be upset if it got accidentally tossed in the trash at this point either.",US,2020-09-22
2,They put some work into it but it pinches my nose too much for comfort.,"I bought this and tried it at the gym yesterday. While I could tell it was engineered well with the filters and securing, it continually pinched my nose so much that I had to keep adjusting it upwards. It got to the point where I couldn't see why I would wear this mask again while exercising. I would much rather wear my other mask while I do have to keep fixing it throughout my workouts, it does not pinch my nose. I would return this if I could but it is not eligible for returns. Maybe another size? I hope the company contacts me because I would really like to make this work if possible.",US,2021-01-05
2,"Great idea, poor execution","Since coronavirus hit I can't buy N95 masks with a 1-way valve anymore, so I thought this would be a suitable replacement. I was wrong. This mask looked good in the description but it is no better than a regular surgical mask... here's why:

-The strap goes around the back of your neck, instead of the back of your head, and it's not very stretchable. So the mask shifts when you move around. The ear straps don't do much to pull it tight against your face. It needs a second strap to hold it tight against the back of your skull.

-The one way valves don't work at all. I can breathe both ways through them.

-The plastic nose piece doesn't hold its shape, and didn't seal around the bridge of my nose...even with the foam gasket on the inner filter. My glasses still fogged up.

-Since its a 2 layer mask it gets really hot. Not very comfortable for summertime wear.

For the $25 price tag I don't think it's worth it...I'll keep reusing the N95 that I found in my garage.",US,2020-08-02
2,"low quality, ineffective","dunno if I got a bad one or they're all like this. Basically none of the air is going through the filter & instead in & out all around the mask. Stitching along the front seam is all frayed. Tried to unbutton the nose clip to put the comfort strip on & the button tore right through the mesh the mask is made out of. The fact that it's made out of mesh is also an issue given there isn't any kind of seal with the filter. I guess it's better than nothing but no way this is more effective than a cheaper (more comfortable) cotton mask or a paper surgical one. I will be returning this & likely the filters I bought to use with them.

Update: the seller refunded me promptly so +1 star for good customer service",US,2020-08-10
2,Design problems with fit,"On large heads, the way the lower strap goes around the back of your head pulls the mask down so that it rolls your ears down. As a result, you end up pinching the nose wire tighter to maintain a tight seal around your nose, which makes it harder to breathe.

My wife has a medium-sized head and does not have the ear-roll problem. However, she had to pinch the nose wire to the point where it was difficult to breath in order to stop it from leaking.

You may have exactly the right-shaped head to make this mask work. But, I suspect most of us will find the fit problematic.",US,2020-07-28
2,I ended up returning it because my glasses still fogged up,"I was looking for a mask solution that prevented my glasses from getting fogged up.
This wasn't it.
Aside from that, I actually prefer a lightweight surgical mask to one that makes me look like Bane, the Super Villain from Batman.
The mask is thick, which makes me feel claustrophobic.
If the three features are comfort, stretch and weight, a cheap surgical mask beats this product hands down.

If you know of a product that actually does keep the glasses from fogging, please reply to this! Thanks.",US,2020-09-27
2,"Comfortable, BUT...","This mask is comfortable and fits securely, but it is made for small faces and it is a dust mask, not for virus protection. In a large man, each downward movement of the lower jaw pulls the mask downward, and two or three such movements completely uncover the nose. Probably not the best mask for those who chew gum or talk while working. You can probably do better, though the search for a suitably designed and constructed American mask is daunting, as the market is currently flooded with designer junk.",US,2020-10-27
2,Comfortable,My husband and I wear the mask for the first time into a furniture showroom where his filter fell onto the floor. I had the same experience the next day. I have changed out the liner and The Mask which is very convenient however no matter what kind of mascot for I still want to scratch my face because they become itchy as a moisture from your breath attaches to the inner lining of the Mask. My husband lost his filter last night from his mask as it just did not stay on that well. I would never say don't buy this mask at least give it a try.,US,2020-06-29
2,If you're looking at this to use to not fog up PPE glasses... don't.,Bought this when COVID broke out because regular masks just fogged up my PPE glasses and this does it as well. Had to make the neck strap so tight to even try to get a good seal and still fogged up glasses and ended up giving me not only a sore neck but also a painful spot on my nose. Speaking of nose the so called clip on the nose bridge that's supposed to clamp down to create a seal doesn't do anything it's like they forgot to put a piece of metal in there to actually work.,US,2020-10-28
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"I am really disappointed in this mask! At first I loved it, but after day 1 the disk-like vents on either side FALL OFF ALL THE TIME! They are fairly easy to reattach, but with one use at least one vent disk WILL FALL OFF! So, I will have to try and find a similar product because the masks with vents REDUCE fogging your eyeglasses when exhaling.",US,2020-06-10
2,Was good until is started to fall apart,"I though I had found a great mask when I first bought this as it was far more comfortable than my N95, and very easy to put on. However, after a couple weeks of wearing I noticed that the vents had a tendency to open themselves and fall off. About a month into using it I noticed that one of the vents completely fell off while I was out, and now it is completely gone, making this mask useless. They really need to look into their design and quality control as this is too expensive for such a critical piece to be flawed like that.",US,2020-07-24
2,Tad too small and failed the flame test too many times,"I got this alongside some much more normal cloth masks.

I was excited for this one but became disappointed very quickly - Unfortunately, it fits poorly with the neck strap system it uses. I also tried the flame test ( blowing through the mask to blow out a lighter/candle ) and it failed far too frequently for me to feel comfortable even compared to regular cloth masks.

Your mileage may vary but I chose to return this as it was not right for me.",US,2020-09-25
2,you need elephant ears!,Nope. This is one of those one size is suppose to fit all deal and most certainly does not. If you have to be one who has smaller than average ears then the straps for the ears are so large and lose with to much slack that they constantly come off which causes the whole mask to simply fall off your face. The neck strap does help a little but not much at all if you can't also use the ears straps for added support so was a worthless item for me. Small ears and or glasses won't work.,US,2020-07-30
2,"Low on comfort, high on price","Unfortunately, this has been the most uncomfortable mask I have ever worn. The velcro strap behind the neck is great and easy to use, but the ear loops do not help to pull the mask up and off the nose. After just a few minutes, my nose was sore and my ears ached. I ended up modifying the ear loops to wrap across the top of my head which has helped take the strain off of my nose. I also replaced the filters with n95 approved materials. It is a good mask overall but needs some help to be comfortable. I expected better for the price I paid for this mask.",US,2020-07-19
2,Comfortable mask but needs a seam around vent holes,This mask is very comfortable and easy to wear. The reason I have given it a lower rating is that the holes for the valves has stretched out and one of the valves has fallen out. Also one of the ear loops has started to come undone.,US,2020-07-12
2,"Good idea, but...",I wanted to use the mask in my woodworking shop but it smashed my nose kind of flat so it is uncomfortable to wear. I really like the way the mask can be put on by velcro straps behind the neck. I like the idea of reusable filters. The hard piece over the top of the nose didn't conform as well as a thin piece of aluminum in other masks. In short I like the basic design of the mask but I wish it were more comfortable to wear.,US,2020-12-18
2,Still fogs up my glasses,"If you're looking at this, and are thinking ""Hey, with two one way breathing valves and a super tight strap to hold it on my face, I bet this mask wont fog up my glasses!"" then let me tell you you are wrong. I know, because thats exactly what i thought when i bought it, and I was wrong. If you're trying to prevent glasses fog, this aint it. Other than that, its a great mask. I like how secure it feels on my face, i don't have to touch it or adjust it once its on... but i still can't see",US,2020-07-16
2,Not made for people with larger faces.,I really wanted to like the mask and I bet I would have if it wasn't for my large facial features and double chin. I have a fairly large nose (very wide and protrudes out a little more that most people). The mask would not let me look straight without it pushing down my noise and making it a little hard to breathe. I also wear glasses and it would not fog up my glasses which is really nice. Unfortunately I can not recommend this to people who are overweight and have a double chin or who have a large nose. I have had this mask for about a 2 months.,US,2020-10-12
2,Looks alright but strap design doesn't keep mask on face,"Stap design makes mask fall down face no matter how it is adjusted on two different people. Good mask design in theory but the strap pulls downward and the mask slips towards the tip of the nose. No elastic in main velcro straps so you get squeezed when turning head either way.

Also smells strange as noted by others. Kind of a plastic-y smell like some materials are still offgassing from manufacture.",US,2020-08-22
2,Not For People With Glasses,"If you wear glasses, the metal adjusting piece across the bridge of the nose interferes with the pads on your glasses. You can't get the mask to fit properly. I wound up cutting the the thing off in an effort to make it fit better. Also, I wasn't a big fan of the velcro strap around the back of the neck. Now I can't even send it back. I'll probably wind up cutting that off too or just using it as is.",US,2020-07-27
2,Women and children only. Not large enough for a grown man.,"I only gave this 2 stars because it is just too small for my face. I am 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 215 lbs, big, but not extremely. The mask is just too small to properly fit my face. With the nose piece on properly it doesn‚Äôt reach my chin. If I pull it down over my chin, the ear straps pull my ears down.

Overall, the quality appears to be great, but it‚Äôs just not suited for a grown man. Maybe women and children only.",US,2020-06-26
2,"Good mask, but the back of a valve got lost, so it's trash now.","Really good mask. It is comfy, and it fits fine. However the back of one of the valves got lost sometime between me putting it into my pants pocket (large lower pants pocket). They are just way too loose, and too easy to come off. I'm going to have to find a way to ghetto-rig a way to fix it, which sucks. $25 mask unusable because of a hole in the side of it now.",US,2020-08-02
2,Tiny mask,"The velcro strap plus semi-elastic material gives the mask the ability to wrap around most heads; however, the actual filter for the mask is so small you can't turn your head or open you mouth to talk without it just sliding down. Add to that the fact that the gaskets just come detached from the outer-mask whenever they feel like it and this is a seriously garbage mask. I can't imagine trying to run with one of these unless you just want to wear it dangling from your ears.
If these had adjustable ear-straps, decent gaskets, and larger filters I think it might be a passable product.",US,2020-07-14
2,Amazingly uncomfortable,"I had tried other masks and only had reservations about their durability or their closure around the nose, but not until this model did I think comfort could be so problematic that you'd be unable to wear the mask. The top area dug into my nose so badly I just couldn't keep it on. I tried adjusting the top plastic strap but making it more comfortable made the important seal just more open and less effective.
I invested a lot of money for two high-quality masks and am really disappointed.
Could it be that many American males might have larger faces than Asians? I'm just guessing. I can't imagine these masks left a factory if people of varying face size tried them all on. It's a simple design issue.",US,2020-07-20
2,The valve kept falling out and getting lost,The valve that was on this kept falling out and getting lost. I tried multiple valves but they all had that problem. People were very angry to see a gaping hole in my mask.,US,2021-01-20
2,These are made little kids not adults.,Once I got my mask I noticed I had drag the nose piece where it drag down where I can‚Äôt breath from my nose. When I pull it up the very bottom of my mask goes to my under lip like it‚Äôs for a toddler mask. Another thing the strap that goes behind the neck feel awkward like I‚Äôm being strangled to look down. The strap should be placed higher and make the mouth area bigger.,US,2021-01-24
2,Happy with the mask but a 'respirator' piece (small plastic piece on front of mask) fell off,"It may just be a fluke of the particular mask I received, but it's not functional any longer even though I just got it. A plastic piece fell off while wearing it randomly and I can't find it.

If there's a way to get a replacement piece for this I'd be happy to change my review as I was happy with the mask before that, but it is now unusable and was a waste for me to buy.",US,2020-08-05
2,Do not buy if you have a smaller head,"If you're a 5,4' or shorter female or a male with a smaller head this probably wont work for you. I'm a 5,4' female and this mask is way too big, it doesnt fit right at all. Its beyond uncomfortable and just frustrating, I spent 20 minutes trying to adjust it and no matter how you put it it's too big and keeps falling, the ear straps wont even stay on. The nose piece also doesnt clamp tight enough to fit smaller noses and scratches you up. I'll be returning it, the only good thing about this mask is how well you can breathe in it. I'm very disappointed that I couldn't make it fit",US,2020-07-21
2,"Too small, but good customer service","This mask is very small and not comfortable. Good for a kid or young teen but not really for an adult male. On a positive note, the company contacted me and offered me a refund. So they have good customer service.",US,2020-08-02
2,Headaches & cheaply made,"At first the mask seemes great. The seal is adequate and I coulf breathe well. After wearing it for an hour I realized my excrutiating headache was being caused by the ear pieces. Then I realized while walking that one of the plastic filtration blocker pieces fell out. Itll do for short usage after I replace that piece, but I wont use it for ling periods of time, the headache is awful. Tried it 3 times at different tightness etc. No differece each time.",US,2020-06-14
2,filters fall off during the ride,"I was very excited by this mask, but within an hour of my ride, the filter fell off. I found it and re-attached it, thinking it was just a fluke, but it was a consistent pattern. Finally, a filter fell off, and I just couldn't find it. What a pain. I thought it best just to return it as defective.",US,2020-06-26
2,Comfortable but fell apart quickly,"Valves just fell right off after third time wearing it. Didn‚Äôt even do anything but pick it up to put it on and they just dropped off. Couldn‚Äôt find the third back piece of one of the valves so I couldn‚Äôt use it anymore. Was traveling at the time so didn‚Äôt try for a replacement. Now it‚Äôs outside the return timeframe. It was the most comfortable mask I‚Äôve had, so far! Too bad it only lasted for three uses!",US,2020-09-02
2,valves issue,"Despite making sure that the valves are fitted with turning them to the right, they are still loose and several times while outside wearing this, one of the valves kept falling out. Contacted seller who has now promised me a replacement. I will update this when I receive the replacement re: valve secure or not",US,2020-08-14
2,Fails in pretty much every category,"Pros: inexpensive, probably works ok if it fits you
Cons: doesn‚Äôt fit me, terrible with glasses, not enough tension in straps over the tops of the ear and the strap behind the neck has zero stretch to it so if you tilt your head up, the mask falls off, pulled down by the neck strap",US,2020-10-14
2,Not as comfortable as advertised,I bought this mask to replace one that looked similar with the ear straps and Velcro neck strap. I‚Äôm very disappointed that this mask doesn‚Äôt fit the same way. The way the neck strap sits pulls the mask down on the nose making it very uncomfortable. It is lightweight and the vents make it breathable,US,2021-01-24
2,Straps from below and leaves the support to your nose,"I put this mask on and felt so happy that I could breath and felt kind of light, until I moved my mouth and the mask came down a little further down my nose. I takes five words for this mask to come off your face because it straps from the lower part of the mask. Makes it kind of ineffective and just for looks that last under five words.",US,2020-08-01
2,Too small for average adult male face,"Mask appears to be good quality. However, as other American adult male consumers have noted, far too small. The bottom of the mask has to ride on top of my chin. If I try to wear it under my chin, the moment you start talking it will pull right off your nose.

Going to have to send back for this reason as I'm not going to be able to use it. Will work for small faces",US,2020-07-25
2,Not great,DIdn't like the fit. DIdn't like the material. Gave it 2 stars because the overall look is interesting. Good start but bad finish.,US,2020-07-16
2,Don‚Äôt waste your money,The Velcro behind the neck is super uncomfortable if you have long hair at all and it doesn‚Äôt even keep the bottom from being open so I don‚Äôt see the point. Even with the Velcro there‚Äôs still a gap under the chin letting particles in and it doesn‚Äôt fit well against the face it pokes out really far making you look like a duck. Waste of money,US,2020-08-27
2,fits small,I bought this mask for my husband to wear while at work since he works in the oilfield I though the strap on the back would help keep it on his face. The mask runs small it wouldn't even fit around my husbands head so he gave it to me. I work at a hospital and figured i would give it a try and it barely fit me the filter on the inside was very uncomfortable and the round black filter covers on the outside kept falling out and off the mask leaving a big round hole so if you ever loose one you are screwed and the mask would be useless.,US,2020-11-12
2,Tight ear straps,This appears to be a well made product but I had to return it because the ear straps are so tight. It appears to be designed for a child or someone with a small face. It was so incredibly uncomfortable that I could wear it for more than about 30 seconds.,US,2020-07-28
2,Not good for big dudes,"I'm 6'4"", not sure what my face measurements are. This mask does not fit my face. Need a bigger one. Wish they offered it in large.",US,2020-06-12
2,Does not stay where it should,I find myself have to constantly pull it up.,US,2021-01-22
2,"Comfortable, but doesn‚Äôt stay together.",My mask fell apart in the middle of the grocery trip. The filter piece has consistently fallen out. Not good in the middle of a pandemic.,US,2020-07-31
2,Not for full size men.,"It is small. Will fit most women, but only men with smaller faces or heads. I wish they made it in men's sizes. Gave it away to a 5' tall female friend.",US,2020-06-25
2,Don‚Äôt fit either of us,"Honestly; these just don‚Äôt fit well. They fall off my face and are too tight on my fianc√©. I wanted to love them and we even purchased extra filters for them but since they don‚Äôt fit, they are kind of a waste for us.",US,2020-07-29
2,Valves fail,I like this mask but the MAJOR downside is the holes in the mask for the plastic valves are cut way to big and they are always falling out.,US,2020-06-26
2,Too small for medium man,"Too small for my husband. Would not stay on, kept sliding down his nose. Fit me a small woman. Very nice quality but bought for him and it doesn‚Äôt work so returned it.",US,2020-11-15
2,Small,"I'm am average size man and this mask is just too small. Not sure who are those for, but definitely not for men.
Also the title says: 7 filters... I only found 3 filters in the package.",US,2020-08-07
2,Bad quality,I bought two of these and I doubted the quality once I got them. So I decided to return one and keep one to try it. It is is bad... Doesn't do the job and it is not breathable at all.,US,2020-07-31
2,"Okay mask, some quality control issues.","I think this would be a decent mask if it had a little better quality control. The nose piece on mine is not really centered, and the stitching near the chin makes it so that it is too small to comfortable go over my chin and nose. I saw some other reviewers say it was a little small, but I do not have a very large head so did not think it would be an issue.

Aesthetically pleasing, however not the highest quality control when it comes to the individual items.",US,2020-08-20
2,plastic breathing valve fell off and could not find it!,"After 2 days of using this product, the plastic valve fell off and now can't be used. I also ordered many extra filters as well. I have contacted the MFG this date and have no response. I will change my review if they make good on this problem.",US,2020-08-24
2,Needs adjustable nosepiece to function well,"Looks cool but is ineffective because the nose piece is plastic and will not hold its shape when compressed. If one wears glasses they fog up and clearly this means that there is a major leak. Fine dust easily escapes the filters and makes me cough. I do much better with an inexpensive mask with a thin metal, adjustable nose piece. The mask is, however, comfortable to wear. I have used this mask for about 3 months off and on when woodworking.",US,2020-11-25
2,Additional Filters were not included in order,Everything else is great about this mask except: it does not protect you from coronavirus and it did not come with the 3 additional filters as alleged. Returning mine.,US,2020-08-21
2,Very uncomfortable,This fits very strangely. The velcro strap sits at a very weird angle it is at the bottom of the mask which causes it to pull the mask down hard on nose. It is impossible to get it to fit at all while moving head. I can get it to be fairly secure if I look down and put it on that way. Then if I try to look up it doesn't stretch enough. The ear bands don't do anything and are completely loose.,US,2020-08-13
2,Even Their Biggest are Too Small,Not a bad mask but their largest size was not even remotely large. I am aware I have a big head and would be most comfortable in a larger mask. But my petite wife tried it on and it fit her just right. Was hoping it would be a better fit and really like the strap but unfortunately it's unwearable for me.,US,2020-10-03
2,Not for larger faces,"Doesn‚Äôt fit my face well. I the ear loops pull really bad. The valves seem to work, but it doesn‚Äôt keep it any cooler than any other mask. Not impressed.",US,2020-07-20
2,"Good idea, bad quality","Got it from all the positive reviews but it is incredibly bulky, uncomfortable, and you still sweat under so not ventilated like I though. Also for the price you‚Äôd think it should fit and look good but it doesn‚Äôt. Disappointed.",US,2020-07-25
2,This thing barely fits,"There was less then an inch of Velcro in the back and if I looked up it would pop apart. Any talking would cause it to come off the nose. The filters dug into the bridge of my nose. It pulled at my ears and was very uncomfortable.

This may be the bee's knees for some folks but it just felt as though it wanted to be covering my neck instead of covering my face.",US,2020-08-15
2,Nice mask but no good for anyone with a beard.,This is not good for guys with beards. I guess I have a really big head or something because it doesn't not fit right and I am not going to shave my beard but I was hoping this mask would work.,US,2020-08-22
2,Meh,"Doesn‚Äôt fit well with bigger head. Velcro lets loose with certain movements.
Breather vents fall out",US,2020-09-19
2,Great product. Bad connectors little black circle things,I really like the product but I was walking and one side of the plastic holders fell off and I didn‚Äôt notice because the other one held it in place. I will change my review if seller reaches out. I don‚Äôt want a refund only replacement parts. I also wana buy some extras,US,2020-07-19
2,Doesn't fit big head as well as I hoped.,"Valves are nice for breathing but they do not fully stop the fogging of glasses. I have a hat size 7 7/8 and the velcro strap just barely fits. Also, when I speak, the mask wants to walk its way down and off. I remedy this by putting the bottom part of the mask on my chin and this helps but at a compromise for total coverage.",US,2020-08-22
2,Designed,Mask design is nice when it comes to comfort not so good inside replacement filters bother your face also it won‚Äôt stretch enough to help out. If I was going to recommend this product to anyone one I would say no,US,2020-07-24
2,Not comfortable,Extremely small for me and I don‚Äôt understand the need for the Velcro straps that go behind the head!,US,2020-08-09
2,Small,"I'm actually pretty disappointed. As a woman, I thought that it would've been too big, but it's actually a bit too small to the point where the nose clip pushes down way too hard on my nose. I will try to wear it some more to see if it stretches, but I'm not too optimistic.",US,2020-07-23
2,Great if jaw not moving,"Initially liked this, because it allows me to breathe in more freely due to vents. Having worn it out and about though, it will not stay covering my nose if I'm chewing gum or even talking.",US,2020-12-14
2,IT JUST DOESN'T FIT WELL,It is entirely too small for my face and I do not have what would be considered a large or fat face. The mask undoubtedly was made in China thus made for smaller faces than most American males.,US,2020-10-06
2,fell apart after one use.,Fell apart after one use and half of none of the vents is missing...waste of money.,US,2020-09-18
2,Kinda small.,Not a great fit for a 6‚Äô2 man. A little small and short to the ears.,US,2020-11-18
2,Do not recommend.,"Very unhappy with this. The vents always fall off! It also does not fit my face well, despite me measuring before ordering. It is also made in China, and I am very unhappy about that. It should say stuff like that before ordering.",US,2020-10-19
2,Don‚Äôt buy this mask,"The round air vents keep popping out which completely exposes you to the air. Same is happening to my husband‚Äôs mask too. I advise buying a mask without these round, detachable vents.",US,2020-07-23
2,Not for adult or glasses wearers,"I would recommend something else for sure! Tough to breathe through and will not fit an adult male especially if you have any sort of beard. Also it does not keep you glasses from fogging up, which I was hoping for.",US,2020-08-23
2,Valves too loose,Lost valve on one side trying to find correct size for replacement,US,2020-07-02
2,It looks good,Dust mask w/ 3 filters. Back neck strap is uncomfortable.,US,2020-06-28
2,Definitely not one size fits all,I didnt like the way the product fits my face i felt like it was a little small its uncomfortable as well because of the size im really not happy with the item,US,2021-01-09
2,good quality but ....,Good quality and fits good until you start to talk. Then it just slides down your face until it's over your mouth but not your nose. If you don't plan on talking then it might be ok for you.,US,2020-07-23
2,Poor construction,Product not durable the vent came out within a couple of wears. Used for COVID 19 protection.,US,2020-09-12
2,One size does not fit all,"I got this mask to protect against dust while doing yardwork. I wish I could say it worked. I was not able to wear the mask due to the size. If I tucked my chin down and didn't breathe, it would stay in place, otherwise I could only cover my mouth or my nose.",US,2020-08-07
2,Won't work with sunglasses,"This is a 2 star product. It would not fit my head, and everytime I was breathing with it on , it would fog up my sunglasses. I noticed that it was not sealed, so air can come out f rut om there",US,2020-06-25
2,did not work for me at all,"Did not work for me at all, might work for you,",US,2020-09-07
2,Not for a mans face,"this does not fit a mans face, the mask without the filter is thin so very breathable, but there is no filter pocket so your face is literally touching the filter material.",US,2020-08-18
2,Not a good fit,I bought this for my bike rides. Have a more than average sized head and this mask keeps sliding down no matter how tight it fits me. Very frustrating to keep needing to readjust the mask every few minutes. I would assume runners would have a difficult time too.,US,2020-10-16
2,Bit too small !,A bit too small,US,2020-10-17
2,Too small for a mans face.,I ordered these for my husband and one for my son. they are too small for both of them. They fit a small womans face farely well. I would not order again,US,2020-08-07
2,Fit and smell,It grips down on the top of my ears no matter what I do and the inside of the mask has this strange smell I can do nothing about that lingers on my face for awhile afterwards. I just bought it a day or two ago. Wi==I will be returning it. DO NOT PURCHASE!!,US,2020-08-10
2,Don‚Äôt get what you pay for,Not a bad mask! Says it came with three carbon filters. There were none. I did not see a way to contact to rectify. So a bad rating,US,2020-06-08
2,Poor Workmanship,The plastic breather pieces do NOT stay on the mask. The holes for the plastic are cut much too large. It looks like they were cut by hand with a very dull blade. All of these that I purchased had irregular shaped and oversized holes.,US,2021-01-11
2,Keeps falling apart,"The port keeps falling out. Every time I put it on, I have to constantly make sure the filters are snapped in place! One fell out while I was walking.",US,2020-08-02
2,Not so comfy,Its ok the back neck slash is really uncomfortable. Quality is meh not the best.,US,2020-08-01

2,Canister fell apart while riding my bike other than that pretty nice!,Round Cartriges came loose and fell off during my bike ride. This is an excellent product with the exception that I can use it anymore due to it falling apart while wearing it. Need manufacturer to make this right please.,US,2020-08-09

2,Why not get this one again.,This thing Fogg's up all over the place even when You pinch the nose piece.,US,2021-01-30
2,Disappointed!,"One of ""vents"" literally broke after about a hour of mild exercise. It was easy to fix, but it happens so often I don't even use it anymore",US,2020-07-18
2,Too pricey,Too pricey you can get 2 or 3 for this price,US,2020-06-30
2,Ill Fitting,The product tends to slip off easily when the head is articulated. No good for running and the lack of adjustable straps aside from the back one insures that the fit is tenuous for larger or smaller individuals. Would not recommend.,US,2020-08-18
2,Kinda flimsy,This doesn't feel like it was designed for the pandemic it would probably last a long time used now and again for projects but just won't hold up for daily wear.,US,2021-01-05
2,effective ness,it‚Äôs stretched too much and plastic filters fall out often,US,2020-08-31
2,Too bulky,Not for females,US,2020-10-11
2,Doesn't work well with glasses,"If you wear the kind of glasses that use nose pieces, this mask isn't for you. Also, the mask's own nose piece is not particularly adjustable; I sent the mask to a friend after I gave up on it, but they couldn't get it to fit, either.",US,2020-06-12
2,Good for kids not adults,"Mask is uncountable for my face. It would certainly fit a kids face well, but not an adult face... every time I talk, the mask gets pulled down by my chin, and off y nose.",US,2020-08-15

2,Tiny,This thing is tiny or I have a giant head.,US,2020-07-25
2,Beware small size,Nice mask but unfortunately its way to small for an adult male,US,2020-09-04
2,"Poorly made, not worth $25",The mask is poorly made and the filters it came with don‚Äôt fit right. The nose bridge was sewn on crooked so it doesn‚Äôt fit right and the filters won‚Äôt fit properly.,US,2020-07-15
2,NOT FOGGING UP MY glasses,I don't like the way it feels and my glasses fogs up when breathing. I tried adjusting the strap in the back and it did not stop the fogging of my glasses.,US,2020-06-16
2,Fit and comfort,Mask will not stay in place. Ear pieces are too loose. Need to return.,US,2020-10-10
2,It‚Äôs coo but not the best just looks good you can still smell throw it,It‚Äôs coo but not the best just looks good you can still smell throw it but is ok how it goes around the back of your head covers everything üëçüèΩ,US,2020-08-13
2,Falls Apart,"This mask falls apart way to easy. Not sturdy at all. Lost one of those vent things while commuting, it fell right out.",US,2020-10-13

2,Strap pivots mask down.,Very simply the strap pivots the mask DOWN and uncovers the bridge of the nose.,US,2020-07-05

2,Ok I suppose,"Meh, doesn‚Äôt seem like this will really protect as marketed.",US,2020-07-28
2,Too small,Too small feels like it is made for children,US,2020-11-30
2,Zieht und dr√ºckt,"Ich habe eine Maske f√ºr den Sport gesucht. Durch die Ventile usw. hat diese Maske mir einen guten Eindruck gemacht.

Halt:
Die Maske h√§lt durch ein Klettverschluss am Nacken sehr gut. Leider ist die Maske zu steif und man verliert viel von der Beweglichkeit. Wenn ich die Maske press am Gesicht tragen m√∂chte und am Nacken entsprechend fest mache, kann ich den Kopf nicht mehr in den Nacken legen, weil sich dann der Teil an der Nase stark gezogen wird. Das ist sehr unangenehm.

Ventile:
Die L√∂cher f√ºr die Ventile sind etwas zu gro√ü. Mir ist es nun schon mehrmals passiert, dass sich der Stoff √ºber das Ventil geschoben hat.
Die Ventile lassen sich leicht √∂ffnen und das Inlay leicht austauschen.",Germany,2020-08-07
2,Not comfortable,Not comfortable,US,2020-06-13
2,Easy fit,It had hair in the package,US,2020-06-11

2,Disappointed,Waste of money,US,2020-07-02
2,Improvement required as ear loop should be adjustable.,Dislike.,US,2020-07-22
2,"Nasenclip nicht entfernbar, trotz Angabe auf Verpackung","Also generell w√§re es eine tolle Maske. Aber ich finde es l√§cherlich dass man angeblich den Nasenclip entfernen k√∂nnen soll, wie auf der Packung beschrieben und beim Versuch das zu tun ist mir der Clip komplett ausgerissen. Keine Chance den abzubekommen, ohne dass er nicht mehr wieder drauf geht... Damit ist die Maske jetzt also direkt nach der Ankunft ""kaputt""...",Germany,2020-07-31
2,Schlechter als jede Stoffmaske,Das beste zuerst. Es ist eine Maske. F√ºr den Preis aber viel zu billig verarbeitet. Die Ventile sind einfach √ºber ein gestanztes Loch mit dem d√ºnnen Oberstoff und dem Filter verbunden. Dadurch f√§llt die Maske nach kurzer Zeit auseinander. Auch der Austausch des Filtervlieses ger√§t so zu einer Frickelei. Der Tragecomfort ist je nach Kopfform ungen√ºgend da die Halter √ºber den Ohren nicht flexibel sind.,Germany,2020-10-04
